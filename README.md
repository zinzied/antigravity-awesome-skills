## New Here? Start Here!

**Welcome to the V5.4.0 Workflows Edition.** This isn't just a list of scripts; it's a complete operating system for your AI Agent.

### 1. 🐣 Context: What is this?

**Antigravity Awesome Skills** (Release 5.4.0) is a massive upgrade to your AI's capabilities.

AI Agents (like Claude Code, Cursor, or Gemini) are smart, but they lack **specific tools**. They don't know your company's "Deployment Protocol" or the specific syntax for "AWS CloudFormation".
**Skills** are small markdown files that teach them how to do these specific tasks perfectly, every time.

### 2. ⚡️ Quick Start (1 minute)

Install once; then use Starter Packs in [docs/BUNDLES.md](docs/BUNDLES.md) to focus on your role.

1. **Install**:

   ```bash
   # Default path: ~/.agent/skills
   npx antigravity-awesome-skills
   ```

2. **Verify**:

   ```bash
   test -d ~/.agent/skills && echo "Skills installed in ~/.agent/skills"
   ```

3. **Run your first skill**:

   > "Use **@brainstorming** to plan a SaaS MVP."

4. **Pick a bundle**:
   - **Web Dev?** start with `Web Wizard`.
   - **Security?** start with `Security Engineer`.
   - **General use?** start with `Essentials`.

### 3. 🧠 How to use

Once installed, just ask your agent naturally:

> "Use the **@brainstorming** skill to help me plan a SaaS."
> "Run **@lint-and-validate** on this file."

👉 **NEW:** [**Complete Usage Guide - Read This First!**](docs/USAGE.md) (answers: "What do I do after installation?", "How do I execute skills?", "What should prompts look like?")

## Compatibility & Invocation

These skills follow the universal **SKILL.md** format and work with any AI coding assistant that supports agentic skills.

| Tool            | Type | Invocation Example                | Path              |
| :-------------- | :--- | :-------------------------------- | :---------------- |
| **Claude Code** | CLI  | `>> /skill-name help me...`       | `.claude/skills/` |
| **Gemini CLI**  | CLI  | `(User Prompt) Use skill-name...` | `.gemini/skills/` |
| **Codex CLI**   | CLI  | `(User Prompt) Use skill-name...` | `.codex/skills/`  |
| **Antigravity** | IDE  | `(Agent Mode) Use skill...`       | `.agent/skills/`  |
| **Cursor**      | IDE  | `@skill-name (in Chat)`           | `.cursor/skills/` |
| **Copilot**     | Ext  | `(Paste content manually)`        | N/A               |
| **OpenCode**    | CLI  | `opencode run @skill-name`        | `.agents/skills/`  |
| **AdaL CLI**    | CLI  | `(Auto) Skills load on-demand`    | `.adal/skills/`   |

> [!TIP]
> **Universal Path**: We recommend cloning to `.agent/skills/`. Most modern tools (Antigravity, recent CLIs) look here by default.
> **OpenCode Path Update**: opencode path is changed to `.agents/skills` for global skills. See [Place Files](https://opencode.ai/docs/skills/#place-files) directive on OpenCode Docs.

> [!WARNING]
> **Windows Users**: this repository uses **symlinks** for official skills.
> See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for the exact fix.

---

## Installation

To use these skills with **Claude Code**, **Gemini CLI**, **Codex CLI**, **Cursor**, **Antigravity**, **OpenCode**, or **AdaL**:

### Option A: npx (recommended)

```bash
# Default: ~/.agent/skills (universal)
npx antigravity-awesome-skills

# Cursor
npx antigravity-awesome-skills --cursor

# Claude Code
npx antigravity-awesome-skills --claude

# Gemini CLI
npx antigravity-awesome-skills --gemini

# Codex CLI
npx antigravity-awesome-skills --codex

# OpenCode
npx antigravity-awesome-skills --path .agents/skills

# Custom path
npx antigravity-awesome-skills --path ./my-skills
```

Run `npx antigravity-awesome-skills --help` for all options. If the directory already exists, the installer runs `git pull` to update.

### Option B: git clone

```bash
# Universal (works with most tools)
git clone https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills.git .agent/skills

# Claude Code specific
git clone https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills.git .claude/skills

# Gemini CLI specific
git clone https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills.git .gemini/skills

# Codex CLI specific
git clone https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills.git .codex/skills

# Cursor specific
git clone https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills.git .cursor/skills

# OpenCode
git clone https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills.git .agents/skills
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### `npx antigravity-awesome-skills` returns 404

Use the GitHub package fallback:

```bash
npx github:sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills
```

### Windows clone issues (symlinks)

This repository uses symlinks for official skills. Enable Developer Mode or run Git as Administrator, then clone with:

```bash
git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills.git .agent/skills
```

### Skills installed but not detected by your tool

Install to the tool-specific path (for example `.claude/skills`, `.gemini/skills`, `.codex/skills`, `.cursor/skills`) or use the installer flags (`--claude`, `--gemini`, `--codex`, `--cursor`, `--path`).

### Update an existing installation

```bash
git -C ~/.agent/skills pull
```

### Reinstall from scratch

```bash
rm -rf ~/.agent/skills
npx antigravity-awesome-skills
```

---

## Curated Collections

**Bundles** are curated groups of skills for a specific role or goal (for example: `Web Wizard`, `Security Engineer`, `OSS Maintainer`).

They help you avoid picking from 860+ skills one by one.

### ⚠️ Important: Bundles Are NOT Separate Installations!

**Common confusion:** "Do I need to install each bundle separately?"

**Answer: NO!** Here's what bundles actually are:

**What bundles ARE:**
- ✅ Recommended skill lists organized by role
- ✅ Curated starting points to help you decide what to use
- ✅ Time-saving shortcuts for discovering relevant skills

**What bundles are NOT:**
- ❌ Separate installations or downloads
- ❌ Different git commands
- ❌ Something you need to "activate"

### How to use bundles:

1. **Install the repository once** (you already have all skills)
2. **Browse bundles** in [docs/BUNDLES.md](docs/BUNDLES.md) to find your role
3. **Pick 3-5 skills** from that bundle to start using in your prompts
4. **Reference them in your conversations** with your AI (e.g., "Use @brainstorming...")

For detailed examples of how to actually use skills, see the [**Usage Guide**](docs/USAGE.md).

### Examples:

- Building a SaaS MVP: `Essentials` + `Full-Stack Developer` + `QA & Testing`.
- Hardening production: `Security Developer` + `DevOps & Cloud` + `Observability & Monitoring`.
- Shipping OSS changes: `Essentials` + `OSS Maintainer`.

## Antigravity Workflows

Bundles help you choose skills. Workflows help you execute them in order.

- Use bundles when you need curated recommendations by role.
- Use workflows when you need step-by-step execution for a concrete goal.

Start here:

- [docs/WORKFLOWS.md](docs/WORKFLOWS.md): human-readable playbooks.
- [data/workflows.json](data/workflows.json): machine-readable workflow metadata.

Initial workflows include:

- Ship a SaaS MVP
- Security Audit for a Web App
- Build an AI Agent System
- QA and Browser Automation (with optional `@go-playwright` support for Go stacks)
