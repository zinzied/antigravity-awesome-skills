## New Here? Start Here!

**Welcome to the current interactive web edition.** This isn't just a list of scripts; it's a complete operating system for your AI agent.

### 1. 🐣 Context: What is this?

**Antigravity Awesome Skills** (Release 7.9.1) is a broad, production-oriented upgrade to your AI's capabilities.

AI Agents (like Claude Code, Cursor, or Gemini) are smart, but they lack **specific tools**. They don't know your company's "Deployment Protocol" or the specific syntax for "AWS CloudFormation".
**Skills** are small markdown files that teach them how to do these specific tasks perfectly, every time.

### 2. ⚡️ Quick Start (1 minute)

Install once; then use Starter Packs in [docs/users/bundles.md](docs/users/bundles.md) to focus on your role.

1. **Install**:

   ```bash
   # Default: ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills (Antigravity global). Use --path for other locations.
   npx antigravity-awesome-skills
   ```

2. **Verify**:

   ```bash
   test -d ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills && echo "Skills installed in ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills"
   ```

3. **Run your first skill**:

   > "Use **@brainstorming** to plan a SaaS MVP."

4. **Pick a bundle**:
   - **Web Dev?** start with `Web Wizard`.
   - **Security?** start with `Security Engineer`.
   - **General use?** start with `Essentials`.

### 3. 🧠 How to use

Once installed, just ask your agent naturally:

> "Use the **@brainstorming** skill to help me plan a SaaS."
> "Run **@lint-and-validate** on this file."

👉 **NEW:** [**Complete Usage Guide - Read This First!**](docs/users/usage.md) (answers: "What do I do after installation?", "How do I execute skills?", "What should prompts look like?")

| :-------------- | :--- | :-------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Claude Code** | CLI  | `>> /skill-name help me...`       | `.claude/skills/`                                                     |
| **Gemini CLI**  | CLI  | `(User Prompt) Use skill-name...` | `.gemini/skills/`                                                     |
| **Codex CLI**   | CLI  | `(User Prompt) Use skill-name...` | `.codex/skills/`                                                      |
| **Kiro CLI**    | CLI  | `(Auto) Skills load on-demand`    | Global: `~/.kiro/skills/` · Workspace: `.kiro/skills/`                |
| **Kiro IDE**    | IDE  | `/skill-name or (Auto)`           | Global: `~/.kiro/skills/` · Workspace: `.kiro/skills/`                |
| **Antigravity** | IDE  | `(Agent Mode) Use skill...`       | Global: `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/` · Workspace: `.agent/skills/` |
| **Cursor**      | IDE  | `@skill-name (in Chat)`           | `.cursor/skills/`                                                     |
| **Copilot**     | Ext  | `(Paste content manually)`        | N/A                                                                   |
| **OpenCode**    | CLI  | `opencode run @skill-name`        | `.agents/skills/`                                                     |
| **AdaL CLI**    | CLI  | `(Auto) Skills load on-demand`    | `.adal/skills/`                                                       |

> [!TIP]
> **Default installer path**: `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills` (Antigravity global). Use `--path ~/.agent/skills` for workspace-specific install. For manual clone, `.agent/skills/` works as workspace path for Antigravity.
> **OpenCode Path Update**: opencode path is changed to `.agents/skills` for global skills. See [Place Files](https://opencode.ai/docs/skills/#place-files) directive on OpenCode Docs.

> [!TIP]
> **Windows Users**: use the standard install commands. The legacy `core.symlinks=true` / Developer Mode workaround is no longer required for this repository.

## Installation

To use these skills with **Claude Code**, **Gemini CLI**, **Codex CLI**, **Kiro CLI**, **Kiro IDE**, **Cursor**, **Antigravity**, **OpenCode**, or **AdaL**:

### Option A: npx (recommended)

```bash
npx antigravity-awesome-skills
```

2. Verify the default install:

```bash
test -d ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills && echo "Skills installed"
```

3. Use your first skill:

```text
Use @brainstorming to plan a SaaS MVP.
```

4. Browse starter collections in [`docs/users/bundles.md`](docs/users/bundles.md) and execution playbooks in [`docs/users/workflows.md`](docs/users/workflows.md).

### Option B: Claude Code plugin marketplace

If you use Claude Code and prefer the plugin marketplace flow, this repository now ships a root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```text
/plugin marketplace add sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills
/plugin install antigravity-awesome-skills
```

This installs the same repository-backed skill library through Claude Code's plugin marketplace entrypoint.

| Custom path    | `npx antigravity-awesome-skills --path ./my-skills`    | Depends on your tool                                 |

## Security Posture

These skills are continuously reviewed and hardened, but the collection is not "safe by default". They are instructions and examples that can include risky operations by design.

- Runtime hardening now protects the `/api/refresh-skills` mutation flow (method/host checks and optional token gate) before any repo mutation.
- Markdown rendering in the web app avoids raw HTML passthrough (`rehype-raw`) and follows safer defaults for skill content display.
- A repo-wide `SKILL.md` security scan checks for high-risk command patterns (for example `curl|bash`, `wget|sh`, `irm|iex`, command-line token examples) with explicit allowlisting for deliberate exceptions.
- Maintainer-facing tooling has additional path/symlink checks and parser robustness guards for safer sync, index, and install operations.
- Security test coverage for endpoint authorization, rendering safety, and doc-risk patterns is part of the normal CI/release validation flow.

- `@architecture` for system and component design.
- `@test-driven-development` for TDD-oriented work.
- `@doc-coauthoring` for structured documentation writing.
- `@lint-and-validate` for lightweight quality checks.
- `@create-pr` for packaging work into a clean pull request.
- `@debugging-strategies` for systematic troubleshooting.
- `@api-design-principles` for API shape and consistency.
- `@frontend-design` for UI and interaction quality.
- `@security-auditor` for security-focused reviews.

## Three Real Examples

```text
Use @brainstorming to turn this product idea into a concrete MVP plan.
```

```text
Use @security-auditor to review this API endpoint for auth and validation risks.
```

## Curated Collections

**Bundles** are curated groups of skills for a specific role or goal (for example: `Web Wizard`, `Security Engineer`, `OSS Maintainer`).

They help you avoid picking through the full catalog one by one.

### ⚠️ Important: Bundles Are NOT Separate Installations!

**Common confusion:** "Do I need to install each bundle separately?"

**Answer: NO!** Here's what bundles actually are:

**What bundles ARE:**

- ✅ Recommended skill lists organized by role
- ✅ Curated starting points to help you decide what to use
- ✅ Time-saving shortcuts for discovering relevant skills

**What bundles are NOT:**

- ❌ Separate installations or downloads
- ❌ Different git commands
- ❌ Something you need to "activate"

### How to use bundles:

1. **Install the repository once** (you already have all skills)
2. **Browse bundles** in [docs/users/bundles.md](docs/users/bundles.md) to find your role
3. **Pick 3-5 skills** from that bundle to start using in your prompts
4. **Reference them in your conversations** with your AI (e.g., "Use @brainstorming...")

For detailed examples of how to actually use skills, see the [**Usage Guide**](docs/users/usage.md).

### Examples:

- Building a SaaS MVP: `Essentials` + `Full-Stack Developer` + `QA & Testing`.
- Hardening production: `Security Developer` + `DevOps & Cloud` + `Observability & Monitoring`.
- Shipping OSS changes: `Essentials` + `OSS Maintainer`.

## Antigravity Workflows

Bundles help you choose skills. Workflows help you execute them in order.

- Use bundles when you need curated recommendations by role.
- Use workflows when you need step-by-step execution for a concrete goal.

Start here:

- [docs/users/workflows.md](docs/users/workflows.md): human-readable playbooks.
- [data/workflows.json](data/workflows.json): machine-readable workflow metadata.

Initial workflows include:

- Ship a SaaS MVP
- Security Audit for a Web App
- Build an AI Agent System
- QA and Browser Automation (with optional `@go-playwright` support for Go stacks)
- Design a DDD Core Domain

## Troubleshooting

### Windows install note

Use the normal install flow on Windows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills.git .agent/skills
```

If you have an older clone created around the removed symlink workaround, reinstall into a fresh directory or rerun the `npx antigravity-awesome-skills` installer.

### Windows truncation or context crash loop

If Antigravity or a Jetski/Cortex-based host keeps reopening into a truncation error, use the dedicated recovery guide:

- [`docs/users/windows-truncation-recovery.md`](docs/users/windows-truncation-recovery.md)

That guide includes:

- backup paths before cleanup
- the storage folders that usually need to be cleared
- an optional batch helper adapted from [issue #274](https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills/issues/274)

## Web App

The web app is the fastest way to navigate a large repository like this.

**Run locally:**

```bash
npm run app:install
npm run app:dev
```

That will copy the generated skill index into `apps/web-app/public/skills.json`, mirror the current `skills/` tree into `apps/web-app/public/skills/`, and start the Vite development server.

**Hosted online:** The same app is available at [https://sickn33.github.io/antigravity-awesome-skills/](https://sickn33.github.io/antigravity-awesome-skills/) and is deployed automatically on every push to `main`. To enable it once: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions**.
