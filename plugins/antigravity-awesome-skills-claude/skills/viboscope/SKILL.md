# Viboscope

## Overview

Viboscope helps find compatible people — cofounders, project partners, friends, romantic partners — through deep psychological compatibility matching. It builds a profile across 10 validated dimensions and calculates mathematical compatibility with other users.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when looking for a cofounder or project collaborator
- Use when wanting to find people with compatible work style and values
- Use when checking compatibility with a specific person via invite link

## How It Works

### Step 1: Install

```bash
curl -fsS https://viboscope.com/api/v1/skill -o viboscope.md
```

Save to your platform's skills directory.

### Step 2: Build Profile

The skill guides a 5-minute onboarding that builds a psychological profile using:
- AI assistant portrait (fastest — 2 min for 90%+ profile)
- 5 validated questionnaires (Big Five, Values, Attachment, Conflict, Work Style)
- Context scan from workspace files

### Step 3: Search

Search across 7 contexts: business, romantic, friendship, professional, intellectual, hobby, general. Results include percentage scores and human-readable explanations of why you match.

## Examples

### Example 1: Find a Cofounder

Tell your AI agent: "Install Viboscope and find me a cofounder"

The agent will guide you through profiling, then search for business-compatible matches with aligned values and complementary work styles.

### Example 2: Check Compatibility

Share your invite link: `viboscope.com/match/@your_nick`

When someone opens it with their AI agent, both see a compatibility breakdown.
