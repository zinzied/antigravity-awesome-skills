# SEO-AEO Meta Description Generator

## Overview

Produces 3 title tag variants and 3 meta description variants for any page, each using a different CTR mechanic (benefit lead, question hook, social proof). Also generates Open Graph and Twitter Card tags. Includes a SERP preview block and a variant comparison table with a recommended selection.

Part of the [SEO-AEO Engine](https://github.com/mrprewsh/seo-aeo-engine).

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when a page needs a title tag and meta description written or optimised
- Use when preparing social sharing tags for LinkedIn, X, or WhatsApp
- Use when A/B testing CTR on search results
- Use after the landing-page-writer or blog-writer skill completes

## How It Works

### Step 1: Identify CTR Angle Per Variant
- **V1 Benefit Lead** — leads with the outcome or benefit
- **V2 Question Hook** — opens with the question the searcher is asking
- **V3 Social Proof / Specificity** — leads with a number, stat, or specific claim

### Step 2: Apply Character Limits
- Title tag: 50–60 characters (hard limit: 60)
- Meta description: 140–155 characters (hard limit: 160)
- Never end a description mid-sentence near the limit

### Step 3: Apply CTR Rules
- Primary keyword in first 3 words of every title variant
- Primary keyword in first half of every description variant
- At least one power word per description
- Every description ends with a CTA verb
- Never use "click here", passive openers, or all-caps

### Step 4: Write Social Tags
OG and Twitter tags can be more conversational than SERP tags. Write them as distinct copy — not copy-pastes of the meta description.

## Examples

### Example 1: Landing Page Variants
Title V1: Remote Project Management Software | Syncro
(51 chars) — Keyword first, brand at end
Title V2: Manage Remote Teams Without the Chaos | Syncro
(54 chars) — Pain-point led with power word
Description V1 (Benefit Lead):
Ship faster with your distributed team. Syncro centralises
tasks, async updates, and sprints in one tool. Start free today.
(141 chars) ✅
Description V2 (Question Hook):
Struggling to keep your remote team aligned? Syncro replaces
scattered tools with one async-first workspace. Try it free.
(140 chars) ✅

## Best Practices

- ✅ **Do:** Write 3 variants — always give the user options to test
- ✅ **Do:** Keep OG and Twitter descriptions more conversational than SERP versions
- ✅ **Do:** Verify character count on every variant before outputting
- ❌ **Don't:** Use the same exact-match anchor or keyword more than once per description
- ❌ **Don't:** Copy-paste the meta description into the OG description
- ❌ **Don't:** Let any description end mid-sentence near the character limit

## Common Pitfalls

- **Problem:** Description truncates mid-word in search results
  **Solution:** Always trim a clause rather than letting natural truncation cut the sentence.

- **Problem:** All 3 variants sound identical
  **Solution:** Each variant must use a genuinely different CTR mechanic — not just rearranged words.
