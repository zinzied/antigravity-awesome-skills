# RecallMax — God-Tier Long-Context Memory

## Overview

RecallMax enhances AI agent memory capabilities dramatically. Inject 500K to 1M clean tokens of external context without hallucination drift. Auto-summarize conversations while preserving tone, sarcasm, and intent. Compress multi-turn histories into high-density token sequences.

Free forever. Built by the Genesis Agent Marketplace.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add christopherlhammer11-ai/recallmax
```

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when your agent loses context in long conversations (50+ turns)
- Use when injecting large RAG/external documents into agent context
- Use when you need to compress conversation history without losing meaning
- Use when fact-checking claims across a long thread
- Use for any agent that needs to remember everything

## How It Works

### Step 1: Context Injection

RecallMax cleanly injects external context (documents, RAG results, prior conversations) into the agent's working memory. Unlike naive concatenation, it:
- Deduplicates overlapping content
- Preserves source attribution
- Prevents hallucination drift from context pollution

### Step 2: Adaptive Summarization

As conversations grow, RecallMax automatically summarizes older turns while preserving:
- **Tone** — sarcasm, formality, urgency
- **Intent** — what the user actually wants vs. what they said
- **Key facts** — numbers, names, decisions, commitments
- **Emotional register** — frustration, excitement, confusion

### Step 3: History Compression

Compress a 14-turn conversation history into ~800 high-density tokens that retain full semantic meaning. The compressed output can be re-expanded if needed.

### Step 4: Fact Verification

Built-in cross-reference checks for controversial or ambiguous claims within the conversation context. Flags contradictions and unsupported assertions.

## Best Practices

- ✅ Use RecallMax at the start of long-running agent sessions
- ✅ Enable auto-summarization for conversations beyond 20 turns
- ✅ Use compression before hitting context window limits
- ✅ Let the fact verifier run on high-stakes outputs
- ❌ Don't inject unvetted external content without dedup
- ❌ Don't skip summarization and rely on raw truncation
