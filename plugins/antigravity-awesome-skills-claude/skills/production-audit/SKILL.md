# Production Audit

## Overview

A skill that runs an external audit on a shipped repo's deployed state — live URL, GitHub signals, secrets exposure, RLS gaps, webhook idempotency, indexes, observability, prompt injection, and ten other failure modes that AI-assisted projects routinely miss.

This is **complementary** to in-session security skills (`security-review`, OWASP-style, VibeSec, Trail of Bits). Those scan the editor buffer at write-time. This scans the deployed product after you commit. Different timing, different inputs, different findings. Run both for serious launches.

The skill wraps the [commit.show](https://commit.show) audit engine via the public CLI (`npx commitshow audit . --json`). Stable JSON envelope (`schema_version: "1"`, additive-only). Writes a `.commitshow/audit.{md,json}` sidecar so future agent sessions can read prior state without re-running the engine.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when the user asks "is this production-ready", "what would break in prod", "score my project", "what did I miss", "audit my repo", "ready to ship".
- Use right after merging a feature branch to `main` (helpful as a pre-deploy gate).
- Use before a public launch / Show HN post / investor demo.
- Use when `git log` shows >20 commits since the last `.commitshow/audit.md` was written.

### Skip when

- During active in-session coding — use `security-review` / OWASP-style for line-level patterns. This skill is for post-merge / pre-ship review.
- For library / scaffold-form repos — the engine handles **app form** best; libraries get a partial-substitute score.
- If `.commitshow/audit.json` already exists and is < 1 hour old, read that instead of re-running. Audit is rate-limited (anonymous: 20/IP/day · 5/repo/day · 2000/day global).
- Inside a private / non-GitHub repo — the audit pulls public GitHub signals, so private repos return a `not_found` error.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Run the audit

From the repo root. The CLI is pinned to a known-good range (an attacker-pushed `0.4.x` won't be picked up silently — bumping the floor is a deliberate edit), the sidecar directory is created up-front, and stderr is split off so install/deprecation warnings can't corrupt the JSON envelope:

```bash
mkdir -p .commitshow
npx commitshow@^0.3.23 audit . --json \
  > .commitshow/audit.json \
  2> .commitshow/audit.stderr.log
```

This also writes a human-readable `.commitshow/audit.md` next to it. Subsequent invocations should diff against the prior `audit.json` if it exists, so you can lead with "+5 since yesterday's audit" instead of just an absolute number.

If the user pointed at a remote URL instead of `.`, swap `.` for the URL — keep the same `mkdir -p` + version pin + stderr split:

```bash
mkdir -p .commitshow
npx commitshow@^0.3.23 audit github.com/owner/repo --json \
  > .commitshow/audit.json \
  2> .commitshow/audit.stderr.log
```

### Step 2: Parse the envelope

The JSON envelope is stable (`schema_version: "1"`, additive-only). Read these fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `score.total` | 0-100 production-readiness score |
| `score.delta_since_last` | change vs. parent snapshot · positive = improving |
| `score.band` | `strong` (80+) · `mid` (60-79) · `early` (<60) |
| `concerns[]` | top issues, ordered by impact · each has `axis` + `bullet` |
| `strengths[]` | top 3 things that work · for context only |
| `standing` | optional · only when the project is auditioning on commit.show |
| `snapshot.created_at` / `trigger_type` | when the audit ran |

Concerns are sorted by decision-impact, not severity. Position 1 is the bullet to lead with.

### Step 3: Surface to the user

Lead with score + trajectory in **one sentence**, then the top concerns. Do not dump the full JSON. Format:

```
Score: 82/100 (+5 since yesterday) · band: strong

Top concerns:
  ↓ [Security] No API rate limiting on /auth — IP cap missing
  ↓ [Infrastructure] webhook handler at api/stripe.ts — signature verified, but no
    idempotency-key check (replay attack window open)

Want me to fix the webhook idempotency gap first?
```

Rules:
- Use the exact bullet from `concerns[].bullet` — the audit engine already wrote action-oriented copy.
- Don't list strengths unless the user explicitly asks. They're not actionable in this context.
- Always end with a follow-up question that names a specific concern. Don't ask "what do you want to do?" — ask "fix X first?".
- If `score.delta_since_last` is negative or null, lead with the absolute score only.

### Step 4: If the user picks a concern, scope a fix

For the chosen concern:
1. Read the file(s) cited in the bullet.
2. Confirm the gap matches the description (the engine occasionally over-flags when the issue is mitigated elsewhere).
3. Propose a minimal patch — single-file when possible.
4. **Don't apply without explicit approval.** Show the diff first. The user is deciding what to ship; you're a lens.

After applying a fix, suggest re-running with `--refresh` (same canonical form as Step 1, so `audit.json` stays the source of truth for delta calculations):

```bash
mkdir -p .commitshow
npx commitshow@^0.3.23 audit . --json --refresh \
  > .commitshow/audit.json \
  2> .commitshow/audit.stderr.log
```

## Examples

### Example 1: User asks "is this production-ready?"

```bash
mkdir -p .commitshow
npx commitshow@^0.3.23 audit . --json \
  > .commitshow/audit.json \
  2> .commitshow/audit.stderr.log
```

Then surface:

```
Score: 67/100 · band: mid

Top concerns:
  ↓ [Security] members table uses column-level GRANT but paid_audits_credit
    column lacks SELECT grant — silent 42501 on every read
  ↓ [Infrastructure] stripe.checkout.sessions.create called without
    idempotencyKey — duplicate-charge surface

Want me to fix the column GRANT first? Single SQL line.
```

### Example 2: Cross-check a specific concern

User: "show me where the webhook idempotency gap is"

```bash
cat .commitshow/audit.json | jq '.concerns[] | select(.axis=="Infrastructure")'
```

Find the file path in the bullet, read it, confirm the gap matches.

## Best Practices

- ✅ Always cite the exact bullet from `concerns[].bullet` — they're already action-oriented
- ✅ Lead with score + delta in a single sentence, then concerns
- ✅ End with a specific follow-up question naming a concern
- ✅ Read prior `.commitshow/audit.json` before re-running (within 1h)
- ✅ Use `--refresh` after the user merges a fix so the next audit reflects it
- ❌ Don't dump full JSON to the user
- ❌ Don't list strengths unless the user explicitly asks
- ❌ Don't apply fixes without approval — show diff first
- ❌ Don't fault private repos for not auditing — explain why and suggest making public

## Limitations

- This skill does not replace environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- The audit engine is calibrated for **deployed apps** with a live URL. CLI / library / scaffold form gets a partial-substitute score (max ~45/50 on the audit pillar) — fair but not flattering.
- Behind a corporate firewall blocking `*.supabase.co`, the API call fails. There is no offline mode — the audit relies on the public engine.
- Cold audit takes 60-90s. Cached audits (within 7 days) return instantly. `--refresh` force-bypasses cache (counts against rate limits).

## Security & Safety Notes

- The skill executes `npx commitshow@latest audit ...` which is a network call to a public API at `https://api.commit.show` (proxied to Supabase Edge Functions). No credentials are sent — anonymous usage subject to per-IP / per-URL / global rate limits.
- The CLI writes `.commitshow/audit.{md,json}` in the current working directory. These files are safe to commit (no secrets) but conventionally gitignored as transient artifacts.
- The audit engine **only reads** public GitHub signals. It does not modify the user's repo or push commits.
- All per-finding fix proposals must be shown as diffs and approved by the user before any edit. Never apply without explicit confirmation.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Problem:** Audit returns `not_found` for a private repo
  **Solution:** The engine pulls public GitHub signals only. Either make the repo public or use `--no-network` for local-only deterministic checks.

- **Problem:** Rate limit hit (`429`)
  **Solution:** Wait until next day (limits reset 00:00 UTC) or sign in at commit.show for higher per-repo caps.

- **Problem:** Score seems too low for a polished library / CLI
  **Solution:** The engine biases toward app form. CLI / library / scaffold gets a partial substitute score capped around 45/50 on the audit pillar. Calibration acknowledged trade-off.

- **Problem:** `concerns[]` is empty after re-running
  **Solution:** Re-audit may have hit cache. Use `--refresh` to force-bypass.
