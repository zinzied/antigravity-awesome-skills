# AKF — The AI Native File Format

Every photo has EXIF. Every song has ID3. AKF is the native metadata format for AI-generated content.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to stamp, inspect, or audit provenance and trust metadata on AI-generated or AI-modified files for compliance, review, or handoff workflows.

## After creating or modifying files

```bash
akf stamp <file> --agent <agent-name> --evidence "<what you did>"
```

Evidence examples:
- "generated from user prompt"
- "refactored existing code"
- "tests pass"
- "docs reviewed"

## Before modifying existing files

```bash
akf read <file>          # Check existing trust metadata
akf inspect <file>       # See detailed trust scores
```

## Compliance auditing

```bash
akf audit <file> --regulation eu_ai_act    # EU AI Act Article 50
akf audit <file> --regulation hipaa         # HIPAA
akf audit <file> --regulation sox           # SOX
akf audit <file> --regulation nist_ai       # NIST AI RMF
```

## Classification

- `--label confidential` for finance/secret/internal paths
- `--label public` for README, docs, examples
- Default: `internal`
