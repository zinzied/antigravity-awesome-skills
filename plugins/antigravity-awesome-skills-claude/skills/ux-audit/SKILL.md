# UX Audit

## Overview

Part of [StyleSeed](https://github.com/bitjaru/styleseed), this skill audits usability rather than just visuals. It uses Nielsen's 10 heuristics plus modern mobile UX expectations to find issues in navigation, feedback, recovery, hierarchy, and cognitive load.

## When to Use

- Use when a screen feels awkward even though the code and styling seem correct
- Use when evaluating a flow before or after implementation
- Use when reviewing a mobile-first product for usability regressions
- Use when you want findings framed as user experience problems with remediation

## Audit Framework

Review the target against:
- visibility of system status
- match between system and real-world language
- user control and freedom
- consistency and standards
- error prevention
- recognition rather than recall
- flexibility and efficiency
- aesthetic and minimalist design
- recovery from errors
- help, onboarding, and empty-state guidance

Add mobile-specific checks for reachability, touch ergonomics, input burden, and thumb-friendly action placement.

## Output

Return:
1. A prioritized issue list
2. The heuristic violated by each issue
3. Why the issue matters to real users
4. Specific remediation suggestions for the page, component, or flow

## Best Practices

- Judge the experience from the user's point of view, not the implementer's
- Separate high-severity flow blockers from minor polish issues
- Include recovery and state-management guidance, not only layout comments
- Tie recommendations back to concrete UI changes
