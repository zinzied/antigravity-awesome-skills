# SEO-AEO Landing Page Writer

## Overview

Generates a full, publish-ready landing page following a defined section order with SEO heading structure, AEO extraction blocks, FAQ section, comparison table, social proof, and conversion-focused CTAs. Every section serves a specific purpose in a narrative arc that moves the visitor from awareness to action.

Part of the [SEO-AEO Engine](https://github.com/mrprewsh/seo-aeo-engine).

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when building a landing page for a new product or service
- Use when an existing landing page needs a full SEO and AEO rewrite
- Use when you need a page that can be cited by AI engines like Perplexity or ChatGPT
- Use when you want conversion copy that leads with pain before pitching the product

## How It Works

### Step 1: Map Inputs
Extract product name, audience, primary keyword, pain points, features, benefits, USPs, social proof, and CTAs. Map every feature to a user outcome before writing any copy.

### Step 2: Write AEO Extraction Sentence
Write one 25–40 word sentence that answers "What is [product]?" — standalone, no jargon, placed in a blockquote immediately after the H1. This is the sentence AI engines extract.

### Step 3: Follow the Narrative Arc
Write sections in this exact order:
1. Hero — H1 + AEO sentence + CTA
2. Problem — audience pain, no product mention yet
3. Solution — introduce product as the answer
4. Features as Benefits — table format
5. Social Proof — testimonials, logos, stats
6. Mid-page CTA
7. How It Works — numbered steps
8. Comparison — table with honest competitor comparison
9. FAQ — minimum 6 entries, each under 50 words
10. Trust Signals
11. Final CTA

### Step 4: Run SEO and AEO Checklists
Verify keyword placement, heading hierarchy, FAQ count, AEO block presence, and meta description placeholder before outputting.

## Best Practices

- ✅ **Do:** Write the problem section before mentioning the product — empathy first
- ✅ **Do:** Place the AEO extraction sentence in a blockquote immediately after H1
- ✅ **Do:** Write FAQ answers as standalone — each must make sense without context
- ✅ **Do:** Include at least one honest point in the comparison table where the alternative wins
- ❌ **Don't:** Use "revolutionary", "game-changing", or "best-in-class" anywhere
- ❌ **Don't:** Use "Submit" or "Click Here" as CTA button text
- ❌ **Don't:** Write paragraphs longer than 4 lines

## Common Pitfalls

- **Problem:** Product mentioned in the pain section
  **Solution:** The pain section exists to build empathy. Save the product introduction for the solution section.

- **Problem:** FAQ answers are too long to be extracted by AI engines
  **Solution:** Every FAQ answer must be under 50 words and self-contained.
