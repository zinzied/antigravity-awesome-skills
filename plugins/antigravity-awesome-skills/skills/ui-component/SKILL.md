# UI Component

## Overview

Part of [StyleSeed](https://github.com/bitjaru/styleseed), this skill generates components that respect the Toss seed's design language instead of improvising ad hoc markup and styling. It emphasizes semantic tokens, predictable typing, reusable variants, and mobile-friendly accessibility defaults.

## When to Use

- Use when you need a new UI primitive or composed component inside a StyleSeed-based project
- Use when you want a component to match the existing Toss seed conventions
- Use when a component should be reusable, typed, and design-token driven
- Use when the AI might otherwise invent spacing, colors, or interaction patterns

## How It Works

### Step 1: Read the Local Design Context

Before generating code, inspect the seed's source of truth:
- `CLAUDE.md` for conventions
- `css/theme.css` for semantic tokens
- at least one representative component from `components/ui/`

If the user already has a better local example, follow the local codebase over a generic template.

### Step 2: Choose the Correct Home

Place the output where it belongs:
- `src/components/ui/` for primitives and low-level building blocks
- `src/components/patterns/` for composed sections or multi-part patterns

Do not create a new primitive if an existing one can be extended safely.

### Step 3: Follow the Structural Rules

Use these defaults unless the host project strongly disagrees:
- function declaration instead of a `const` component
- `React.ComponentProps<>` or equivalent native prop typing
- `className` passthrough support
- `cn()` or the project's standard class merger
- `data-slot` for component identification
- CVA or equivalent only when variants are genuinely needed

### Step 4: Use Semantic Tokens Only

Do not hardcode visual values if the design system has a token for them.

Preferred examples:
- `bg-card`
- `text-foreground`
- `text-muted-foreground`
- `border-border`
- `shadow-[var(--shadow-card)]`

### Step 5: Preserve StyleSeed Typography and Spacing

- Use the scale already defined by the seed
- Prefer multiples of 6px
- Use logical spacing utilities where supported
- Keep display and heading text tight, body text readable, captions restrained

### Step 6: Bake in Accessibility

- Touch targets should be at least 44x44px for interactive elements
- Keyboard focus must be visible
- Pass through `aria-*` attributes where appropriate
- Respect reduced-motion preferences for nonessential motion

## Output

Provide:
1. The generated component
2. The target path
3. Any required imports or dependencies
4. Notes on variants, tokens, or follow-up integration work

## Best Practices

- Compose from existing primitives before inventing new ones
- Keep the component API small and predictable
- Prefer semantic layout classes over arbitrary values
- Export named components unless the host project uses another standard consistently
