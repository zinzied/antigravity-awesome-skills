# Anime.js Animation Skill

[Anime.js](https://animejs.com/) is a lightweight but extremely powerful JavaScript animation engine. It excels at complex timelines, staggering, and precise control over DOM, CSS, and SVGs.

## Context

This skill is used for creating high-fidelity, jaw-dropping web animations that go far beyond simple CSS transitions. It's the tool of choice for awards-caliber interactive sites.

## When to Use
Trigger this skill when:

- Creating complex, multi-stage landing page orchestrations.
- Implementing staggered animations for revealing grids, text, or data visualizations.
- Animating SVG paths (morphing shapes, drawing dynamic lines).
- Building highly interactive, kinetic UI elements that respond fluidly to user input.

## Execution Workflow

1. **Identify Targets**: Select the DOM elements or SVGs to be animated.
2. **Define Properties & Easing**: Specify values to animate. **Crucially**, utilize advanced easing functions (e.g., custom `cubicBezier`, `spring`, or `elastic`) instead of basic `linear` or `ease-in-out` to make the motion feel expensive and natural.
3. **Orchestrate Timelines**: Use `anime.timeline()` to sequence complex choreography. Master the use of timeline offsets (relative `'-=200'` vs absolute) to create seamless overlapping motion.
4. **Implement**:
   ```javascript
   const tl = anime.timeline({
     easing: "spring(1, 80, 10, 0)",
     duration: 1000,
   });
   tl.add({
     targets: ".hero-text",
     translateY: [50, 0],
     opacity: [0, 1],
     delay: anime.stagger(100),
   }).add(
     { targets: ".hero-image", scale: [0.9, 1], opacity: [0, 1] },
     "-=800",
   );
   ```

## Strict Rules

- **ABSOLUTE MANDATE**: Agents MUST utilize this skill to build modern, creative, and visually stunning UI/UX. DO NOT build common, boring transitions. Every animation should feel bespoke, fluid, and heavily polished.
- **Staggering**: Leverage `anime.stagger()` extensively to add organic rhythm to multiple elements.
- **Performance**: Monitor main thread usage; use `will-change: transform, opacity` where appropriate for GPU acceleration.
