## Kiro-Specific Workflows

### 1. Serverless Application Development

```
1. Use @brainstorming to design the application architecture
2. Apply @aws-serverless to create Lambda functions
3. Use @aws-cdk to generate infrastructure code
4. Run @test-driven-development to add tests
5. Apply @ci-cd-pipeline to set up deployment
```

### 2. Infrastructure as Code

```
1. Use @architecture to document the system design
2. Apply @terraform-expert to write Terraform modules
3. Run @security-audit to check for vulnerabilities
4. Use @documentation to generate README and runbooks
```

### 3. API Development

```
1. Use @api-design to plan endpoints
2. Apply @typescript-expert for implementation
3. Run @api-security-best-practices for hardening
4. Use @openapi-spec to generate documentation
```

## Advanced Features

### MCP Integration

Kiro's MCP support allows skills to:
- Call external APIs securely
- Query databases with context
- Integrate with AWS services
- Access documentation in real-time

Skills that leverage MCP:
- `@rag-engineer` - RAG system implementation
- `@langgraph` - Agent workflow orchestration
- `@prompt-engineer` - LLM prompt optimization

### Autonomous Operation

Kiro can work independently for extended periods. Use skills to guide long-running tasks:

```
Use @systematic-debugging to investigate and fix all TypeScript errors in the codebase, 
then apply @test-driven-development to add missing tests, and finally run @documentation 
to update all README files.
```

### Context-Aware Assistance

Kiro maintains deep context. Reference multiple skills in complex workflows:

```
I'm building a SaaS application. Use @brainstorming for the MVP plan, 
@aws-serverless for the backend, @react-patterns for the frontend, 
@stripe-integration for payments, and @security-audit for hardening.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Skills Not Loading

```bash
# Check installation path
ls -la ~/.kiro/skills/

# Reinstall if needed
rm -rf ~/.kiro/skills
npx antigravity-awesome-skills --kiro
```

### Skill Not Found

Ensure you're using the correct skill name:

```bash
# List all available skills
ls ~/.kiro/skills/skills/
```

### Permission Issues

```bash
# Fix permissions
chmod -R 755 ~/.kiro/skills/
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with bundles** - Use pre-curated collections for your role
2. **Combine skills** - Reference multiple skills in complex tasks
3. **Be specific** - Clearly state which skill to use and what to do
4. **Iterate** - Let Kiro work autonomously, then refine with additional skills
5. **Document** - Use `@documentation` to keep your codebase well-documented

## Examples

### Example 1: Build a Serverless API

```
I need to build a REST API for a todo application using AWS Lambda and DynamoDB.

Use @brainstorming to design the architecture, then apply @aws-serverless 
to implement the Lambda functions, @dynamodb-patterns for data modeling, 
and @api-security-best-practices for security hardening.

Generate the infrastructure using @aws-cdk and add tests with @test-driven-development.
```

### Example 2: Migrate to Microservices

```
I want to break down this monolithic application into microservices.

Use @architecture to create an ADR for the migration strategy, 
apply @microservices-patterns for service boundaries, 
@docker-expert for containerization, and @kubernetes-expert for orchestration.

Document the migration plan with @documentation.
```

### Example 3: Security Audit

```
Perform a comprehensive security audit of this application.

Use @security-audit to scan for vulnerabilities, @owasp-top-10 to check 
for common issues, @api-security-best-practices for API hardening, 
and @aws-security-best-practices for cloud configuration.

Generate a report with findings and remediation steps.
```
