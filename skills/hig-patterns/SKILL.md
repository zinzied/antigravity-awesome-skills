# Apple HIG: Interaction Patterns

Check for `.claude/apple-design-context.md` before asking questions. Use existing context and only ask for information not already covered.

## Key Principles

1. **Minimize modality.** Use modality only when it is critical to get attention, a task must be completed or abandoned, or saving changes is essential. Prefer non-modal alternatives.

2. **Provide clear feedback.** Every action should produce visible, audible, or haptic response. Activity indicators for indeterminate waits, progress bars for determinate, haptics for physical confirmation.

3. **Support undo over confirmation dialogs.** Destructive actions should be reversible when possible. Undo is almost always better than "Are you sure?"

4. **Launch quickly.** Display a launch screen that transitions seamlessly into the first screen. No splash screens with logos. Restore previous state.

5. **Defer sign-in.** Let users explore before requiring account creation. Support Sign in with Apple and passkeys.

6. **Keep onboarding brief.** Three screens max. Let users skip. Teach through progressive disclosure and contextual hints.

7. **Use progressive disclosure.** Show essentials first, let users drill into details. Don't overwhelm with every option on one screen.

8. **Respect user attention.** Consolidate notifications, minimize interruptions, give users control over alerts. Never use notifications for marketing.

## Pattern Selection Guide

| User Goal | Recommended Pattern | Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| First app experience | Brief onboarding (max 3 screens) + progressive disclosure | Long tutorials, mandatory sign-up |
| Waiting for content | Skeleton screens or progress indicators | Blocking spinners with no context |
| Confirming destructive action | Undo support | Excessive "Are you sure?" dialogs |
| Collecting user input | Inline validation, smart defaults, autofill | Modal forms for simple inputs |
| Requesting permissions | Contextual, just-in-time with explanation | Requesting all permissions at launch |
| Providing feedback | Haptics + visual indicator | Silent actions with no confirmation |
| Organizing preferences | In-app settings for frequent items | Burying all settings in system Settings app |

## Output Format

1. **Recommended pattern with rationale**, citing the relevant reference file.
2. **Step-by-step implementation** covering each screen or state.
3. **Platform variations** for targeted platforms.
4. **Common pitfalls** that violate HIG for this pattern.

## Questions to Ask

1. Where in the app does this pattern appear? What comes before and after?
2. Which platforms?
3. Designing from scratch or improving an existing flow?
4. Does this involve sensitive actions? (Destructive operations, payments, permissions)
