# Apple HIG: Presentation Components

Check for `.claude/apple-design-context.md` before asking questions. Use existing context and only ask for information not already covered.

## Key Principles

1. **Alerts: sparingly, for critical situations.** Errors needing attention, destructive action confirmations, or information requiring acknowledgment. They interrupt flow and demand a response.

2. **Sheets: focused tasks that maintain context.** Slides in from the edge (or attaches to a window on macOS). Use for creating items, editing settings, multi-step forms.

3. **Popovers: non-modal on iPad and Mac.** Appear next to the trigger element, dismissed by tapping outside. For additional information, options, or controls without taking over the screen.

4. **Action sheets: choosing among actions.** Present when picking from multiple actions, especially if one is destructive. iPhone: slide up from bottom. iPad: appear as popovers.

5. **Minimize interruptions.** Before reaching for a modal, consider inline presentation or making the action undoable instead.

6. **Concise, actionable alert text.** Short descriptive title. Brief message body if needed. Button labels should be specific verbs ("Delete", "Save"), not "OK".

7. **Mark destructive actions clearly.** Destructive button style (red text). Place destructive buttons where users are less likely to tap reflexively.

8. **Provide a cancel option** for alerts and action sheets with multiple actions. On action sheets, cancel appears at the bottom, separated.

9. **Digit entry: focused and accessible.** Appropriately sized input fields, automatic advancement between digits, support for paste and autofill.

10. **Adapt presentation to platform.** The same interaction may use different components on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and visionOS.

## Reference Index

| Reference | Topic | Key content |
|---|---|---|
| [alerts.md](references/alerts.md) | Alerts | Button ordering, title/message text, confirmation, destructive actions |
| [action-sheets.md](references/action-sheets.md) | Action sheets | Multiple actions, cancel option, destructive handling |
| [popovers.md](references/popovers.md) | Popovers | Non-modal, dismiss on tap outside, iPad/Mac |
| [sheets.md](references/sheets.md) | Sheets | Modal task, context preservation |
| [digit-entry-views.md](references/digit-entry-views.md) | Digit entry | PIN input, autofill, auto-advance |

## Output Format

1. **Recommended presentation type with rationale** and why alternatives are less suitable.
2. **Content guidelines** -- title, message, button labels per Apple's tone and brevity rules.
3. **Dismiss behavior** -- how the user dismisses and what happens (save, discard, cancel).
4. **Alternatives** -- when the scenario might not need a modal at all (inline feedback, undo, progressive disclosure).

## Questions to Ask

1. What information or action does the presentation need?
2. Blocking or non-blocking?
3. Which platforms?
4. How often does this appear?
