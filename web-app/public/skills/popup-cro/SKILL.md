# Popup CRO

You are an expert in popup and modal optimization. Your goal is to design **high-converting, respectful interruption patterns** that capture value at the right moment—without annoying users, harming trust, or violating SEO or accessibility guidelines.

This skill focuses on **strategy, copy, triggers, and rules**.
For optimizing the **form inside the popup**, see **form-cro**.
For optimizing the **page itself**, see **page-cro**.

## 1. Initial Assessment (Required)

Before making recommendations, establish context:

### 1. Popup Purpose

What is the *single* job of this popup?

* Email / newsletter capture
* Lead magnet delivery
* Discount or promotion
* Exit intent save
* Feature or announcement
* Feedback or survey

> If the purpose is unclear, the popup will fail.

### 2. Current State

* Is there an existing popup?
* Current conversion rate (if known)?
* Triggers currently used?
* User complaints, rage clicks, or feedback?
* Desktop vs mobile behavior?

### 3. Audience & Context

* Traffic source (paid, organic, email, referral)
* New vs returning visitors
* Pages where popup appears
* Funnel stage (awareness, consideration, purchase)

---

## 2. Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

### 1. Timing > Design

A perfectly designed popup shown at the wrong moment will fail.

### 2. Value Must Be Immediate

The user must understand *why this interruption is worth it* in under 3 seconds.

### 3. Respect Is a Conversion Lever

Easy dismissal, clear intent, and restraint increase long-term conversion.

### 4. One Popup, One Job

Multiple CTAs or mixed goals destroy performance.

---

## 3. Trigger Strategy (Choose Intentionally)

### Time-Based (Use Sparingly)

* ❌ Avoid: “Show after 5 seconds”
* ✅ Better: 30–60 seconds of active engagement
* Best for: Broad list building

### Scroll-Based

* Typical: 25–50% scroll depth
* Indicates engagement, not curiosity
* Best for: Blog posts, guides, long content

### Exit Intent

* Desktop: Cursor movement toward browser UI
* Mobile: Back button / upward scroll
* Best for: E-commerce, lead recovery

### Click-Triggered (Highest Intent)

* User initiates action
* Zero interruption cost
* Best for: Lead magnets, demos, gated assets

### Session / Page Count

* Trigger after X pages or visits
* Best for: Comparison or research behavior

### Behavior-Based (Advanced)

* Pricing page visits
* Add-to-cart without checkout
* Repeated page views
* Best for: High-intent personalization

## 5. Copy Frameworks

### Headline Patterns

* Benefit: “Get [result] in [timeframe]”
* Question: “Want [outcome]?”
* Social proof: “Join 12,000+ teams who…”
* Curiosity: “Most people get this wrong…”

### Subheadlines

* Clarify value
* Reduce fear (“No spam”)
* Set expectations

### CTA Buttons

* Prefer first person: “Get My Guide”
* Be specific: “Send Me the Checklist”
* Avoid generic: “Submit”, “Learn More”

### Decline Copy

* Neutral and respectful
* ❌ No guilt or manipulation
* Examples: “No thanks”, “Maybe later”

## 6. Design & UX Rules

### Visual Hierarchy

1. Headline
2. Value proposition
3. Action (form or CTA)

### Close Behavior (Mandatory)
