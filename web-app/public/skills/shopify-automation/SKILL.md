# Shopify Automation via Rube MCP

Automate Shopify operations through Composio's Shopify toolkit via Rube MCP.

## Prerequisites

- Rube MCP must be connected (RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS available)
- Active Shopify connection via `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `shopify`
- Always call `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` first to get current tool schemas

## Setup

**Get Rube MCP**: Add `https://rube.app/mcp` as an MCP server in your client configuration. No API keys needed — just add the endpoint and it works.


1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` responds
2. Call `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `shopify`
3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete Shopify OAuth
4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows

## Core Workflows

### 1. Manage Products

**When to use**: User wants to list, search, create, or manage products

**Tool sequence**:
1. `SHOPIFY_GET_PRODUCTS` / `SHOPIFY_GET_PRODUCTS_PAGINATED` - List products [Optional]
2. `SHOPIFY_GET_PRODUCT` - Get single product details [Optional]
3. `SHOPIFY_BULK_CREATE_PRODUCTS` - Create products in bulk [Optional]
4. `SHOPIFY_GET_PRODUCTS_COUNT` - Get product count [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `product_id`: Product ID for single retrieval
- `title`: Product title
- `vendor`: Product vendor
- `status`: 'active', 'draft', or 'archived'

**Pitfalls**:
- Paginated results require cursor-based pagination for large catalogs
- Product variants are nested within the product object

### 2. Manage Orders

**When to use**: User wants to list, search, or inspect orders

**Tool sequence**:
1. `SHOPIFY_GET_ORDERS_WITH_FILTERS` - List orders with filters [Required]
2. `SHOPIFY_GET_ORDER` - Get single order details [Optional]
3. `SHOPIFY_GET_FULFILLMENT` - Get fulfillment details [Optional]
4. `SHOPIFY_GET_FULFILLMENT_EVENTS` - Track fulfillment events [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `status`: Order status filter ('any', 'open', 'closed', 'cancelled')
- `financial_status`: Payment status filter
- `fulfillment_status`: Fulfillment status filter
- `order_id`: Order ID for single retrieval
- `created_at_min`/`created_at_max`: Date range filters

**Pitfalls**:
- Order IDs are numeric; use string format for API calls
- Default order listing may not include all statuses; specify 'any' for all

### 3. Manage Customers

**When to use**: User wants to list or search customers

**Tool sequence**:
1. `SHOPIFY_GET_ALL_CUSTOMERS` - List all customers [Required]

**Key parameters**:
- `limit`: Number of customers per page
- `since_id`: Pagination cursor

**Pitfalls**:
- Customer data includes order count and total spent
- Large customer lists require pagination

### 4. Manage Collections

**When to use**: User wants to manage product collections

**Tool sequence**:
1. `SHOPIFY_GET_SMART_COLLECTIONS` - List smart collections [Optional]
2. `SHOPIFY_GET_SMART_COLLECTION_BY_ID` - Get collection details [Optional]
3. `SHOPIFY_CREATE_SMART_COLLECTIONS` - Create a smart collection [Optional]
4. `SHOPIFY_ADD_PRODUCT_TO_COLLECTION` - Add product to collection [Optional]
5. `SHOPIFY_GET_PRODUCTS_IN_COLLECTION` - List products in collection [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `collection_id`: Collection ID
- `product_id`: Product ID for adding to collection
- `rules`: Smart collection rules for automatic inclusion

**Pitfalls**:
- Smart collections auto-populate based on rules; manual collections use custom collections API
- Collection count endpoints provide approximate counts

### 5. Manage Inventory

**When to use**: User wants to check or manage inventory levels

**Tool sequence**:
1. `SHOPIFY_GET_INVENTORY_LEVELS` / `SHOPIFY_RETRIEVES_A_LIST_OF_INVENTORY_LEVELS` - Check stock [Required]
2. `SHOPIFY_LIST_LOCATION` - List store locations [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `inventory_item_ids`: Inventory item IDs to check
- `location_ids`: Location IDs to filter by

**Pitfalls**:
- Inventory is tracked per variant per location
- Location IDs are required for multi-location stores

## Common Patterns

### Pagination

- Use `limit` and `page_info` cursor for paginated results
- Check response for `next` link header
- Continue until no more pages available

### GraphQL Queries

For advanced operations:
```
1. Call SHOPIFY_GRAPH_QL_QUERY with custom query
2. Parse response from data object
```

## Known Pitfalls

**API Versioning**:
- Shopify REST API has versioned endpoints
- Some features require specific API versions

**Rate Limits**:
- REST API: 2 requests/second for standard plans
- GraphQL: 1000 cost points per second
