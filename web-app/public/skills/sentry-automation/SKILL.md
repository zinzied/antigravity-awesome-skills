# Sentry Automation via Rube MCP

Automate Sentry error tracking and monitoring operations through Composio's Sentry toolkit via Rube MCP.

## Prerequisites

- Rube MCP must be connected (RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS available)
- Active Sentry connection via `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `sentry`
- Always call `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` first to get current tool schemas

## Setup

**Get Rube MCP**: Add `https://rube.app/mcp` as an MCP server in your client configuration. No API keys needed — just add the endpoint and it works.


1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` responds
2. Call `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `sentry`
3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete Sentry OAuth
4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows

## Core Workflows

### 1. Investigate Issues

**When to use**: User wants to find, inspect, or triage error issues

**Tool sequence**:
1. `SENTRY_LIST_AN_ORGANIZATIONS_ISSUES` - List issues across the organization [Required]
2. `SENTRY_GET_ORGANIZATION_ISSUE_DETAILS` - Get detailed info on a specific issue [Optional]
3. `SENTRY_LIST_AN_ISSUES_EVENTS` - View individual error events for an issue [Optional]
4. `SENTRY_RETRIEVE_AN_ISSUE_EVENT` - Get full event details with stack trace [Optional]
5. `SENTRY_RETRIEVE_ISSUE_TAG_DETAILS` - Inspect tag distribution for an issue [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `organization_id_or_slug`: Organization identifier
- `issue_id`: Numeric issue ID
- `query`: Search query (e.g., `is:unresolved`, `assigned:me`, `browser:Chrome`)
- `sort`: Sort order (`date`, `new`, `freq`, `priority`)
- `statsPeriod`: Time window for stats (`24h`, `14d`, etc.)

**Pitfalls**:
- `organization_id_or_slug` is the org slug (e.g., 'my-org'), not the display name
- Issue IDs are numeric; do not confuse with event IDs which are UUIDs
- Query syntax uses Sentry's search format: `is:unresolved`, `assigned:me`, `!has:release`
- Events within an issue can have different stack traces; inspect individual events for details

### 2. Manage Project Issues

**When to use**: User wants to view issues scoped to a specific project

**Tool sequence**:
1. `SENTRY_RETRIEVE_ORGANIZATION_PROJECTS` - List projects to find project slug [Prerequisite]
2. `SENTRY_RETRIEVE_PROJECT_ISSUES_LIST` - List issues for a specific project [Required]
3. `SENTRY_RETRIEVE_ISSUE_EVENTS_BY_ID` - Get events for a specific issue [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `organization_id_or_slug`: Organization identifier
- `project_id_or_slug`: Project identifier
- `query`: Search filter string
- `statsPeriod`: Stats time window

**Pitfalls**:
- Project slugs are different from project display names
- Always resolve project names to slugs via RETRIEVE_ORGANIZATION_PROJECTS first
- Project-scoped issue lists may have different pagination than org-scoped lists

### 3. Configure Alert Rules

**When to use**: User wants to create or manage alert rules for a project

**Tool sequence**:
1. `SENTRY_RETRIEVE_ORGANIZATION_PROJECTS` - Find project for the alert [Prerequisite]
2. `SENTRY_RETRIEVE_PROJECT_RULES_BY_ORG_AND_PROJECT_ID` - List existing rules [Optional]
3. `SENTRY_CREATE_PROJECT_RULE_FOR_ALERTS` - Create a new alert rule [Required]
4. `SENTRY_CREATE_ORGANIZATION_ALERT_RULE` - Create org-level metric alert [Alternative]
5. `SENTRY_UPDATE_ORGANIZATION_ALERT_RULES` - Update existing alert rules [Optional]
6. `SENTRY_RETRIEVE_ALERT_RULE_DETAILS` - Inspect specific alert rule [Optional]
7. `SENTRY_GET_PROJECT_RULE_DETAILS` - Get project-level rule details [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `name`: Alert rule name
- `conditions`: Array of trigger conditions
- `actions`: Array of actions to perform when triggered
- `filters`: Array of event filters
- `frequency`: How often to trigger (in minutes)
- `actionMatch`: 'all', 'any', or 'none' for condition matching

**Pitfalls**:
- Project-level rules (CREATE_PROJECT_RULE) and org-level metric alerts (CREATE_ORGANIZATION_ALERT_RULE) are different
- Conditions, actions, and filters use specific JSON schemas; check Sentry docs for valid types
- `frequency` is in minutes; setting too low causes alert fatigue
- `actionMatch` defaults may vary; explicitly set to avoid unexpected behavior

### 4. Manage Releases

**When to use**: User wants to create, track, or manage release versions

**Tool sequence**:
1. `SENTRY_LIST_ORGANIZATION_RELEASES` - List existing releases [Optional]
2. `SENTRY_CREATE_RELEASE_FOR_ORGANIZATION` - Create a new release [Required]
3. `SENTRY_UPDATE_RELEASE_DETAILS_FOR_ORGANIZATION` - Update release metadata [Optional]
4. `SENTRY_CREATE_RELEASE_DEPLOY_FOR_ORG` - Record a deployment for a release [Optional]
5. `SENTRY_UPLOAD_RELEASE_FILE_TO_ORGANIZATION` - Upload source maps or files [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `version`: Release version string (e.g., '1.0.0', commit SHA)
- `projects`: Array of project slugs this release belongs to
- `dateReleased`: Release timestamp (ISO 8601)
- `environment`: Deployment environment name (e.g., 'production', 'staging')

**Pitfalls**:
- Release versions must be unique within an organization
- Releases can span multiple projects; use the `projects` array
- Deploying a release is separate from creating it; use CREATE_RELEASE_DEPLOY
- Source map uploads require the release to exist first

### 5. Monitor Organization and Teams

**When to use**: User wants to view org structure, teams, or member lists

**Tool sequence**:
1. `SENTRY_GET_ORGANIZATION_DETAILS` or `SENTRY_GET_ORGANIZATION_BY_ID_OR_SLUG` - Get org info [Required]
2. `SENTRY_LIST_TEAMS_IN_ORGANIZATION` - List all teams [Optional]
3. `SENTRY_LIST_ORGANIZATION_MEMBERS` - List org members [Optional]
4. `SENTRY_GET_PROJECT_LIST` - List all accessible projects [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `organization_id_or_slug`: Organization identifier
- `cursor`: Pagination cursor for large result sets

**Pitfalls**:
- Organization slugs are URL-safe identifiers, not display names
- Member lists may be paginated; follow cursor pagination
- Team and member visibility depends on the authenticated user's permissions

### 6. Manage Monitors (Cron Monitoring)

**When to use**: User wants to update cron job monitoring configuration

**Tool sequence**:
1. `SENTRY_UPDATE_A_MONITOR` - Update monitor configuration [Required]

**Key parameters**:
- `organization_id_or_slug`: Organization identifier
- `monitor_id_or_slug`: Monitor identifier
- `name`: Monitor display name
- `schedule`: Cron schedule expression or interval
- `checkin_margin`: Grace period in minutes for late check-ins
- `max_runtime`: Maximum expected runtime in minutes

**Pitfalls**:
- Monitor slugs are auto-generated from the name; use slug for API calls
- Schedule changes take effect immediately
- Missing check-ins trigger alerts after the margin period

## Common Patterns

### ID Resolution

**Organization name -> Slug**:
```
1. Call SENTRY_GET_ORGANIZATION_DETAILS
2. Extract slug field from response
```

**Project name -> Slug**:
```
1. Call SENTRY_RETRIEVE_ORGANIZATION_PROJECTS
2. Find project by name, extract slug
```

### Pagination

- Sentry uses cursor-based pagination with `Link` headers
- Check response for cursor values
- Pass cursor in next request until no more pages

### Search Query Syntax

- `is:unresolved` - Unresolved issues
- `is:resolved` - Resolved issues
- `assigned:me` - Assigned to current user
- `assigned:team-slug` - Assigned to a team
- `!has:release` - Issues without a release
- `first-release:1.0.0` - Issues first seen in release
- `times-seen:>100` - Seen more than 100 times
- `browser:Chrome` - Filter by browser tag

## Known Pitfalls

**ID Formats**:
- Organization: use slug (e.g., 'my-org'), not display name
- Project: use slug (e.g., 'my-project'), not display name
- Issue IDs: numeric integers
- Event IDs: UUIDs (32-char hex strings)

**Permissions**:
- API token scopes must match the operations being performed
- Organization-level operations require org-level permissions
- Project-level operations require project access

**Rate Limits**:
- Sentry enforces per-organization rate limits
- Implement backoff on 429 responses
- Bulk operations should be staggered
