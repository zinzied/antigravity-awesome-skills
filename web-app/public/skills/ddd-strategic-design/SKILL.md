# DDD Strategic Design

## Use this skill when

- Defining core, supporting, and generic subdomains.
- Splitting a monolith or service landscape by domain boundaries.
- Aligning teams and ownership with bounded contexts.
- Building a shared ubiquitous language with domain experts.

## Do not use this skill when

- The domain model is stable and already well bounded.
- You need tactical code patterns only.
- The task is purely infrastructure or UI oriented.

## Instructions

1. Extract domain capabilities and classify subdomains.
2. Define bounded contexts around consistency and ownership.
3. Establish a ubiquitous language glossary and anti-terms.
4. Capture context boundaries in ADRs before implementation.

If detailed templates are needed, open `references/strategic-design-template.md`.

## Required artifacts

- Subdomain classification table
- Bounded context catalog
- Glossary with canonical terms
- Boundary decisions with rationale

## Examples

```text
Use @ddd-strategic-design to map our commerce domain into bounded contexts,
classify subdomains, and propose team ownership.
```

## Limitations

- This skill does not produce executable code.
- It cannot infer business truth without stakeholder input.
- It should be followed by tactical design before implementation.
