# VideoDB Skills

## Purpose

The only video skill your agent needs. Upload any video, connect real-time streams, search inside by what was said or shown, build complex editing workflows with overlays, generate AI media, add subtitles, and get instant streaming links — all via the VideoDB Python SDK.

## When to Use This Skill

- User wants to upload and process videos from YouTube, URLs, or local files
- User needs to search for moments by speech or visual scenes
- User asks for transcription, subtitles, or subtitle styling
- User wants to edit clips — trim, combine, add text/image/audio overlays
- User needs AI-generated media (images, video, music, sound effects, voiceovers)
- User wants to transcode, change resolution, or reframe for social platforms
- User needs real-time screen or audio capture with AI transcription
- User asks for playable streaming links for any video output

## Setup

### Step 1: Install the skill

```bash
npx skills add video-db/skills
```

### Step 2: Run setup

```
/videodb setup
```

The agent guides API key setup ($20 free credits, no credit card), installs the SDK, and verifies the connection.

Alternatively, set the API key manually:

```bash
export VIDEO_DB_API_KEY=sk-xxx
```

### Step 3: Install the SDK

```bash
pip install "videodb[capture]" python-dotenv
```
