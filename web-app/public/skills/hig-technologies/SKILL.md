# Apple HIG: Technologies

Check for `.claude/apple-design-context.md` before asking questions. Use existing context and only ask for information not already covered.

## Key Principles

### General

1. **Apple technologies extend app capabilities through system integration.** Each technology has established user-facing patterns; deviating creates confusion and erodes trust.

2. **Privacy and user control are paramount.** Especially for health, payment, and identity technologies. Request only needed data, explain why, respect choices.

### Siri and Voice

3. **Natural, predictable, recoverable.** Clear conversational intent phrases that complete quickly and confirm results. Support App Shortcuts for proactive suggestions. Handle errors with clear fallbacks.

### Payments and Commerce

4. **Transparent and frictionless.** Standard Apple Pay button styles. Never ask for card details when Apple Pay is available. Clearly describe what the user is buying, the price, and whether it's one-time or subscription.

### Health and Fitness

5. **Health data is deeply personal.** Explain the health benefit before requesting access. CareKit tasks should be encouraging. ResearchKit consent flows must be thorough, readable, and respect autonomy.

### Smart Home

6. **Simple and reliable.** Immediate response when controlling devices. Clear device state. Graceful handling of connectivity issues.

### Augmented Reality

7. **Genuine value, not gimmicks.** Use AR when spatial context improves understanding. Guide setup (surface, lighting, space). Provide clear exit back to standard interaction.

### Machine Learning and Generative AI

8. **Enhance without surprising.** Smart suggestions, image recognition, text prediction. Clearly attribute AI-generated content. Controls to edit, regenerate, or dismiss. Let users correct mistakes.

### Identity and Authentication

9. **Sign in with Apple as top option.** Standard button styles. Respect email hiding preference. ID Verifier: guided flows, don't store sensitive data beyond what verification requires.

### Cloud and Data

10. **Invisible and reliable sync.** Data appears on all devices without manual intervention. Handle conflicts gracefully. Never lose data.

### Shared Experiences

11. **Real-time participation.** SharePlay: support multiple participants, show presence, handle latency. AirPlay: appropriate Now Playing metadata.

### Automotive

12. **Driver safety first.** Minimize interaction complexity, large touch targets, no distracting content. Only permitted app types: audio, messaging, EV charging, navigation, parking, quick food ordering.

### Accessibility

13. **Baseline requirement.** Every element has a meaningful VoiceOver label, trait, and action. Support Dynamic Type, Switch Control, and other assistive technologies. Test entirely with VoiceOver enabled.
