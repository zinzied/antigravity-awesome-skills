# Microsoft Teams Automation via Rube MCP

Automate Microsoft Teams operations through Composio's Microsoft Teams toolkit via Rube MCP.

## Prerequisites

- Rube MCP must be connected (RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS available)
- Active Microsoft Teams connection via `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `microsoft_teams`
- Always call `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` first to get current tool schemas

## Setup

**Get Rube MCP**: Add `https://rube.app/mcp` as an MCP server in your client configuration. No API keys needed — just add the endpoint and it works.


1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` responds
2. Call `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `microsoft_teams`
3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete Microsoft OAuth
4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows

## Core Workflows

### 1. Send Channel Messages

**When to use**: User wants to post a message to a Teams channel

**Tool sequence**:
1. `MICROSOFT_TEAMS_TEAMS_LIST` - List teams to find target team [Prerequisite]
2. `MICROSOFT_TEAMS_TEAMS_LIST_CHANNELS` - List channels in the team [Prerequisite]
3. `MICROSOFT_TEAMS_TEAMS_POST_CHANNEL_MESSAGE` - Post the message [Required]

**Key parameters**:
- `team_id`: UUID of the team (from TEAMS_LIST)
- `channel_id`: Channel ID (from LIST_CHANNELS, format: '19:...@thread.tacv2')
- `content`: Message text or HTML
- `content_type`: 'text' or 'html'

**Pitfalls**:
- team_id must be a valid UUID format
- channel_id must be in thread format (e.g., '19:abc@thread.tacv2')
- TEAMS_LIST may paginate (~100 items/page); follow @odata.nextLink to find all teams
- LIST_CHANNELS can return 403 if user lacks access to the team
- Messages over ~28KB can trigger 400/413 errors; split long content
- Throttling may return 429; use exponential backoff (1s/2s/4s)

### 2. Send Chat Messages

**When to use**: User wants to send a direct or group chat message

**Tool sequence**:
1. `MICROSOFT_TEAMS_CHATS_GET_ALL_CHATS` - List existing chats [Optional]
2. `MICROSOFT_TEAMS_LIST_USERS` - Find users for new chats [Optional]
3. `MICROSOFT_TEAMS_TEAMS_CREATE_CHAT` - Create a new chat [Optional]
4. `MICROSOFT_TEAMS_TEAMS_POST_CHAT_MESSAGE` - Send the message [Required]

**Key parameters**:
- `chat_id`: Chat ID (from GET_ALL_CHATS or CREATE_CHAT)
- `content`: Message content
- `content_type`: 'text' or 'html'
- `chatType`: 'oneOnOne' or 'group' (for CREATE_CHAT)
- `members`: Array of member objects (for CREATE_CHAT)

**Pitfalls**:
- CREATE_CHAT requires the authenticated user as one of the members
- oneOnOne chats return existing chat if one already exists between the two users
- group chats require at least one member with 'owner' role
- member user_odata_bind must use full Microsoft Graph URL format
- Chat filter support is very limited; filter client-side when needed

### 3. Create Online Meetings

**When to use**: User wants to schedule a Microsoft Teams meeting

**Tool sequence**:
1. `MICROSOFT_TEAMS_LIST_USERS` - Find participant user IDs [Optional]
2. `MICROSOFT_TEAMS_CREATE_MEETING` - Create the meeting [Required]

**Key parameters**:
- `subject`: Meeting title
- `start_date_time`: ISO 8601 start time (e.g., '2024-08-15T10:00:00Z')
- `end_date_time`: ISO 8601 end time (must be after start)
- `participants`: Array of user objects with user_id and role

**Pitfalls**:
- end_date_time must be strictly after start_date_time
- Participants require valid Microsoft user_id (GUID) values, not emails
- This creates a standalone meeting not linked to a calendar event
- For calendar-linked meetings, use OUTLOOK_CALENDAR_CREATE_EVENT with is_online_meeting=true

### 4. Manage Teams and Channels

**When to use**: User wants to list, create, or manage teams and channels

**Tool sequence**:
1. `MICROSOFT_TEAMS_TEAMS_LIST` - List all accessible teams [Required]
2. `MICROSOFT_TEAMS_GET_TEAM` - Get details for a specific team [Optional]
3. `MICROSOFT_TEAMS_TEAMS_LIST_CHANNELS` - List channels in a team [Optional]
4. `MICROSOFT_TEAMS_GET_CHANNEL` - Get channel details [Optional]
5. `MICROSOFT_TEAMS_TEAMS_CREATE_CHANNEL` - Create a new channel [Optional]
6. `MICROSOFT_TEAMS_LIST_TEAM_MEMBERS` - List team members [Optional]
7. `MICROSOFT_TEAMS_ADD_MEMBER_TO_TEAM` - Add a member to the team [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `team_id`: Team UUID
- `channel_id`: Channel ID in thread format
- `filter`: OData filter string (e.g., "startsWith(displayName,'Project')")
- `select`: Comma-separated properties to return

**Pitfalls**:
- TEAMS_LIST pagination: follow @odata.nextLink in large tenants
- Private/shared channels may be omitted unless permissions align
- GET_CHANNEL returns 404 if team_id or channel_id is wrong
- Always source IDs from list operations; do not guess ID formats

### 5. Search Messages

**When to use**: User wants to find messages across Teams chats and channels

**Tool sequence**:
1. `MICROSOFT_TEAMS_SEARCH_MESSAGES` - Search with KQL syntax [Required]

**Key parameters**:
- `query`: KQL search query (supports from:, sent:, attachments, boolean logic)

**Pitfalls**:
- Newly posted messages may take 30-60 seconds to appear in search
- Search is eventually consistent; do not rely on it for immediate delivery confirmation
- Use message listing tools for real-time message verification

## Common Patterns

### Team and Channel ID Resolution

```
1. Call MICROSOFT_TEAMS_TEAMS_LIST
2. Find team by displayName
3. Extract team id (UUID format)
4. Call MICROSOFT_TEAMS_TEAMS_LIST_CHANNELS with team_id
5. Find channel by displayName
6. Extract channel id (19:...@thread.tacv2 format)
```

### User Resolution

```
1. Call MICROSOFT_TEAMS_LIST_USERS
2. Filter by displayName or email
3. Extract user id (UUID format)
4. Use for meeting participants, chat members, or team operations
```

### Pagination

- Teams/Users: Follow @odata.nextLink URL for next page
- Chats: Auto-paginates up to limit; use top for page size (max 50)
- Use `top` parameter to control page size
- Continue until @odata.nextLink is absent

## Known Pitfalls

**Authentication and Permissions**:
- Different operations require different Microsoft Graph permissions
- 403 errors indicate insufficient permissions or team access
- Some operations require admin consent in the Azure AD tenant

**ID Formats**:
- Team IDs: UUID format (e.g., '87b0560f-fc0d-4442-add8-b380ca926707')
- Channel IDs: Thread format (e.g., '19:abc123@thread.tacv2')
- Chat IDs: Various formats (e.g., '19:meeting_xxx@thread.v2')
- User IDs: UUID format
- Never guess IDs; always resolve from list operations

**Rate Limits**:
- Microsoft Graph enforces throttling
- 429 responses include Retry-After header
- Keep requests to a few per second
- Batch operations help reduce total request count

**Message Formatting**:
- HTML content_type supports rich formatting
- Adaptive cards require additional handling
- Message size limit is approximately 28KB
- Split long content into multiple messages
