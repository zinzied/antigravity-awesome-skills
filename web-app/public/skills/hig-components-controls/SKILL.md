# Apple HIG: Selection and Input Controls

Check for `.claude/apple-design-context.md` before asking questions. Use existing context and only ask for information not already covered.

## Key Principles

1. **Clear current state.** Users must always see what is selected. Toggles show on/off, segmented controls highlight the active segment, pickers display the current selection.

2. **Prefer standard system controls.** Built-in controls provide consistency and accessibility. Custom controls introduce a learning curve and may break assistive features.

3. **Toggles for binary states.** On or off. In Settings-style screens, changes take effect immediately. In modal forms, changes commit on confirmation.

4. **Segmented controls for mutually exclusive options.** 2-5 items, roughly equal importance, short labels.

5. **Sliders for continuous values.** When precise numeric input is not critical. Provide min/max labels or icons for range endpoints.

6. **Pickers for long option lists.** Too many options for a segmented control. Works well for dates, times, structured data.

7. **Steppers for small, precise adjustments.** Increment/decrement in fixed steps. Display current value next to the stepper with reasonable min/max bounds.

8. **Text fields for short, single-line input.** Text views for multi-line. Configure keyboard type to match expected input (email, URL, number).

9. **Combo boxes: text input + selection list.** macOS. Type a value or choose from a predefined list when custom values are valid.

10. **Token fields: discrete values as visual tokens.** macOS. For email recipients, tags, or collections of discrete items.

11. **Gauges and rating indicators display values.** Gauges show a value within a range. Rating indicators show ratings (often stars). Display-only; use interactive variants for input.

## Output Format

1. **Control recommendation with rationale** and why alternatives are less suitable.
2. **State management** -- how the control communicates current state and whether changes apply immediately or on confirmation.
3. **Validation approach** -- when to show errors and how to communicate rules.
4. **Accessibility** -- labels, traits, hints for VoiceOver.

## Questions to Ask

1. What type of data? (Boolean, choice from fixed set, numeric, free-form text?)
2. How many options?
3. Which platforms? (Combo boxes and token fields are macOS-only)
4. Settings screen or inline form?
