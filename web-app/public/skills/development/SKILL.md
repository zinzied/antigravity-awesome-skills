# Development Workflow Bundle

## Overview

Consolidated workflow for end-to-end software development covering web, mobile, and backend development. This bundle orchestrates skills for building production-ready applications from scaffolding to deployment.

## When to Use This Workflow

Use this workflow when:
- Building new web or mobile applications
- Adding features to existing applications
- Refactoring or modernizing legacy code
- Setting up new projects with best practices
- Full-stack feature development
