# AgentFolio

**Role**: Autonomous Agent Discovery Guide

Use this skill when you want to **discover, compare, and research autonomous AI agents** across ecosystems.
AgentFolio is a curated directory at https://agentfolio.io that tracks agent frameworks, products, and tools.

This skill helps you:

- Find existing agents before building your own from scratch.
- Map the landscape of agent frameworks and hosted products.
- Collect concrete examples and benchmarks for agent capabilities.

## Capabilities

- Discover autonomous AI agents, frameworks, and tools by use case.
- Compare agents by capabilities, target users, and integration surfaces.
- Identify gaps in the market or inspiration for new skills/workflows.
- Gather example agent behavior and UX patterns for your own designs.
- Track emerging trends in agent architectures and deployments.

## How to Use AgentFolio

1. **Open the directory**
   - Visit `https://agentfolio.io` in your browser.
   - Optionally filter by category (e.g., Dev Tools, Ops, Marketing, Productivity).

2. **Search by intent**
   - Start from the problem you want to solve:  
     - “customer support agents”  
     - “autonomous coding agents”  
     - “research / analysis agents”
   - Use keywords in the AgentFolio search bar that match your domain or workflow.

3. **Evaluate candidates**
   - For each interesting agent, capture:
     - **Core promise** (what outcome it automates).
     - **Input / output shape** (APIs, UI, data sources).
     - **Autonomy model** (one-shot, multi-step, tool-using, human-in-the-loop).
     - **Deployment model** (SaaS, self-hosted, browser, IDE, etc.).

4. **Synthesize insights**
   - Use findings to:
     - Decide whether to integrate an existing agent vs. build your own.
     - Borrow successful UX and safety patterns.
     - Position your own agent skills and workflows relative to the ecosystem.

## Example Workflows

### 1) Landscape scan before building a new agent

- Define the problem: “autonomous test failure triage for CI pipelines”.
- Use AgentFolio to search for:
  - “testing agent”, “CI agent”, “DevOps assistant”, “incident triage”.
- For each relevant agent:
  - Note supported platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins, etc.).
  - Capture how they explain autonomy and safety boundaries.
  - Record pricing/licensing constraints if you plan to adopt instead of build.

### 2) Competitive and inspiration research for a new skill

- If you plan to add a new skill (e.g., observability agent, security agent):
  - Use AgentFolio to find similar agents and features.
  - Extract 3–5 concrete patterns you want to emulate or avoid.
  - Translate those patterns into clear requirements for your own skill.

### 3) Vendor shortlisting

- When choosing between multiple agent vendors:
  - Use AgentFolio entries as a neutral directory.
  - Build a comparison table (columns: capabilities, integrations, pricing, trust & security).
  - Use that table to drive a more formal evaluation or proof-of-concept.

## Example Prompts

Use these prompts when working with this skill in an AI coding agent:

- “Use AgentFolio to find 3 autonomous AI agents focused on code review. For each, summarize the core value prop, supported languages, and how they integrate into developer workflows.”
- “Scan AgentFolio for agents that help with customer support triage. List the top options, their target customer size (SMB vs. enterprise), and any notable UX patterns.”
- “Before we build our own research assistant, use AgentFolio to map existing research / analysis agents and highlight gaps we could fill.”

## When to Use

This skill is applicable when you need to **discover or compare autonomous AI agents** instead of building in a vacuum:

- At the start of a new agent or workflow project.
- When evaluating vendors or tools to integrate.
- When you want inspiration or best practices from existing agent products.
