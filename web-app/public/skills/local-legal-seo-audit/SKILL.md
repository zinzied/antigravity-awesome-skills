# Local Legal SEO Audit

You are an expert in local SEO for legal and professional services. Your goal is to audit and improve the organic visibility of law firms, attorneys, forensic experts, legal consultants, and related professional services with a local or regional presence.

This skill is scoped to the **specific needs of legal and professional services sites**, where trust signals, local authority, E-E-A-T, and directory presence are the primary ranking levers.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- You need to audit or improve local SEO for a law firm, attorney, forensic expert, or similar legal/professional services website.
- The goal is to improve visibility in Google local pack/maps, legal directories, and local organic results for specific practice areas or cities.

Do **not** use this skill when:
- You need a general SEO health check across any niche (use `seo-audit`).
- You are investigating a sudden traffic or rankings crash (use `seo-forensic-incident-response`).

## Initial Assessment

Before auditing, gather context:

1. **Practice & Business Context**
   - What is the practice area? (criminal law, civil litigation, forensic expertise, notary, etc.)
   - Solo practitioner, small firm, or large office?
   - Single location or multiple offices?
   - Primary geographic target? (city, state, region, national)

2. **Current Visibility**
   - Are they appearing in Google local pack (maps results)?
   - What keywords are they currently ranking for?
   - Do they have a Google Business Profile?
   - Any competitor firms consistently outranking them?

3. **Existing Assets**
   - Do they have a website? CMS used?
   - Do they have a Google Business Profile?
   - Are they listed in legal directories (Jusbrasil, OAB, Avvo, Justia, FindLaw, etc.)?
   - Do they have any reviews?

4. **Goals**
   - Drive phone calls and contact form submissions?
   - Rank for specific case types (e.g., "advogado criminal em [cidade]")?
   - Build authority for forensic reports or expert witness services?

### Experience

  - Bar registration number or professional council registration (OAB, CFC, etc.)
  - Areas of specialization clearly stated
  - Publications, articles, or academic contributions
  - Speaking engagements or media appearances
- Content written or reviewed by a qualified professional
- Accurate, up-to-date legal information

### Authoritativeness
- Is the firm/expert cited or referenced by external sources?
- Are they listed in authoritative legal directories?

### Trustworthiness
- Clear "About" page with real people and credentials

- Privacy policy and terms of use
- Secure site (HTTPS, valid SSL)
- No misleading claims or guarantees of outcomes

## On-Page SEO Audit

### Practice Area Pages

Each major practice area or service should have a dedicated, optimized page.

**Check for:**
- One page per distinct practice area (e.g., "Defesa Criminal", "Perícia Digital", "Laudo Grafotécnico")
- Primary keyword in title tag, H1, and URL
- Unique, expert-written content per page
- Internal links to and from the homepage and other related pages
- Clear calls to action (phone number, WhatsApp button, contact form)
- Schema markup for LegalService or ProfessionalService (see schema-markup skill)

**Common issues:**
- All services crammed onto a single page
- Generic content not differentiated by specialty
- No clear geographic signal on practice area pages

### Location Pages

For firms serving multiple cities or regions:

- Dedicated page per location with unique content
- City/neighborhood keyword in title, H1, and URL
- Embed Google Maps on each location page
- NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistent with GBP
- Local landmarks, courthouse references, or regional context
- No copy-paste duplicate content across location pages

### Homepage

- Clear headline communicating practice area + location
- Primary keyword (e.g., "Escritório de Advocacia Criminal em Belo Horizonte")
- Trust signals above the fold: years of experience, credentials, bar number
- Social proof: client count, case count, review snippets
- Clear primary CTA (call, WhatsApp, free consultation)

### Title Tags & Meta Descriptions

- Format for legal pages: `[Service] em [City] | [Firm Name]`
- Include primary keyword naturally
- Meta descriptions: highlight differentiator (experience, specialization, availability)
- No duplicate titles or descriptions across pages

### Heading Structure

- Single H1 per page with primary keyword
- H2s for subsections (subtopics of the practice area)
- H3s for supporting details
- No headings used purely for styling

## Content Strategy for Legal Sites

### FAQ Content

Legal FAQ pages rank well for long-tail queries and build trust.

- Use FAQ schema markup for rich results
- Keep answers accurate, brief, and written in plain language

### Blog / Legal Articles

- Target informational queries potential clients search before hiring
- Organize by practice area topic cluster
- Include author byline with credentials

### For Forensic Experts

- Publish case-type explainers (e.g., "Como funciona uma perícia grafotécnica")

## Reviews & Reputation Audit
