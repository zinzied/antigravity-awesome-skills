This release merges PRs #514, #516, and #517, then lands the direct maintainer fix for issue #518 on `main` before cutting `v10.1.0`. It expands the skill library with the new `mmx-cli` installer-ready MiniMax workflow, upgrades `zipai-optimizer` to the latest protocol shape, adds optional license provenance fields to the contributor-facing skill schema, and folds in the post-`v10.0.0` limitations-backfill work plus the required maintainer follow-up on contributor syncing and README source credits.

## New Skills

- **mmx-cli** - installs and uses the official MiniMax CLI for text, image, video, speech, music, vision, and web-search workflows from the terminal.

## Improvements

- **skill schema license provenance** - adds optional `license` and `license_source` frontmatter fields plus contributor guidance and PR checklist coverage so downstream tooling can resolve upstream licensing without re-fetching source repos.
- **zipai-optimizer refresh** - updates the ZipAI protocol skill with adaptive verbosity, ambiguity-first execution, smarter input filtering, and sharper output/pruning rules.
- **limitations audit hardening** - backfills missing `## Limitations` sections across canonical skills and generated plugin mirrors, and adds regression coverage so the repo-wide audit stays green.
- **README maintenance fixes** - corrects the stale `Browse 1,340+ Skills` table-of-contents anchor tracked in issue #518 and keeps contributor/source-credit surfaces aligned after the MiniMax merge.

## Who should care

- **MiniMax users** get a ready-to-install CLI skill instead of piecing together command patterns from upstream docs.
- **Skill authors and downstream indexers** get machine-readable license provenance fields and updated contributor guidance for externally sourced material.
- **Agent-behavior tinkerers** get a broader ZipAI optimization protocol with clearer rules for verbosity, filtering, and surgical output.
- **Maintainers and release operators** get the limitations-audit hardening plus the recorded merge hygiene needed to keep README credits and contributor surfaces accurate on `main`.

- Workflows: [docs/users/workflows.md](https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/workflows.md)

This release focuses on repository reliability rather than new skill volume. It merges the Windows validation and activation hardening from PR #457, adds stronger smoke coverage for the batch activation path, and finishes a broad `## When to Use` cleanup so the repository stays within the current quality bar without carrying contributor-side generated drift.

## New Skills

- **None in this release** - `9.7.0` is a reliability and documentation-hardening release.

## Improvements

- **Windows activation reliability** - makes `scripts/activate-skills.bat` safer around helper discovery, Python probing, archive-prefix overrides, and fallback activation behavior.
- **Cross-platform validation consistency** - normalizes path handling in registry and validation utilities so Windows path separators no longer create false negatives in tooling and tests.
- **Windows smoke coverage** - adds dedicated batch-script smoke coverage, including the missing-helper fallback path, and refreshes supporting installer and plugin tests.
- **Skill guidance cleanup** - adds explicit `## When to Use` sections across a large set of `SKILL.md` files so trigger intent is clearer and warning-budget checks stay green.
- **Release hygiene** - keeps contributor PRs source-only while letting `main` own the generated catalog sync after merge.

## Who should care

- **Windows users** get a more reliable activation path and fewer path-related validation surprises.
- **Maintainers** get cleaner contributor PR handling, better smoke coverage, and a release path aligned with the current generated-artifact contract.
- **Anyone browsing skills directly** gets clearer `When to Use` guidance across a much larger portion of the library.

## Credits

- **[@Al-Garadi](https://github.com/Al-Garadi)** for the Windows validation and skill-guidance cleanup merged in PR #457.

This release folds the full open PR batch into `main` and centers on two major content expansions for growth teams. It adds an SEO/AEO content engine and a large psychology-driven marketing pack, while also tightening the web-app skill card hover state and pulling in the latest `yaml` patch release so the repository and installer surface stay current.

## New Skills

- **SEO-AEO Engine bundle** - merges PR #446 with 8 skills for keyword research, content clustering, landing pages, long-form blog structure, internal linking, metadata, schema, and SEO/AEO auditing.
- **Psychology skills pack** - merges PR #451 with 20 research-backed skills for profiling, persuasion, pricing psychology, onboarding, pitch strategy, UX persuasion, copywriting, and visual-emotion design.

## Improvements

- **Web app hover stability** - merges PR #449 to keep the home-page `SkillCard` readable on hover with a lighter lift/shadow treatment instead of palette inversion.
- **Dependency refresh** - merges PR #450 to bump `yaml` from `2.8.2` to `2.8.3`.
- **README credit sync** - refreshes contributor and community-source credits on `main` immediately after the merged PR batch, including the upstream `mrprewsh/seo-aeo-engine` source.

## Who should care

- **Growth, SEO, and content teams** get a full pipeline for keyword discovery, cluster planning, structured landing pages, schema, internal linking, and publish-time audits.
- **Marketing and UX teams** get a larger psychology-oriented pack for messaging, pricing, onboarding, social proof, objections, and conversion design.
- **Web-app users** get a cleaner hover treatment on the skill cards in the homepage UI.

## [9.5.1] - 2026-04-03 - "npm Runtime Dependency Fix"

> **Patch release to restore `npx antigravity-awesome-skills` installs after the published CLI started failing to resolve `yaml` at runtime**

This release fixes a packaging regression in `9.5.0`. The installer entrypoint loads `tools/lib/skill-utils.js`, which depends on `yaml`, but the published npm package declared that module only as a development dependency. In clean `npx` environments this caused the installer to crash immediately with `Error: Cannot find module 'yaml'`, as reported in issue `#445`.

## New Skills

- **None in this release** — `9.5.1` is a focused patch release for the published npm installer.

## Improvements

- **Runtime dependency fix**: moved `yaml` from `devDependencies` to runtime `dependencies` so the published CLI bundle installs everything required by `tools/bin/install.js` and `tools/lib/skill-utils.js`.
- **Packaging regression coverage**: extended the npm package contents test to assert that `yaml` remains declared as a runtime dependency for the installer contract.
- **Installer verification**: re-ran the package dry-run and installer-focused tests to confirm the published artifact and filtered install flow no longer reproduce the missing-module failure from issue `#445`.

## Credits

- **Issue #445 reporter** for isolating the `yaml` packaging regression in the published npm CLI artifact.

## [9.5.0] - 2026-04-03 - "Selective Installs and 30K Stars"

> Installable skill library update for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, OpenCode, and related AI coding assistants.

Start here:

- Install: `npx antigravity-awesome-skills`
- Choose your tool: [README -> Choose Your Tool](https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills#choose-your-tool)
- Best skills by tool: [README -> Best Skills By Tool](https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills#best-skills-by-tool)
- Bundles: [docs/users/bundles.md](https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/bundles.md)
- Workflows: [docs/users/workflows.md](https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/workflows.md)

This release expands the library with four practical additions while making installs much more manageable for context-sensitive runtimes. It merges the current open PR batch, adds `humanize-chinese` directly on `main`, introduces first-class installer filtering by `risk`, `category`, and `tags`, and updates the docs so OpenCode-style `.agents/skills` setups start from a reduced install instead of overwhelming the runtime. It also marks a project milestone: the repository crossed **30K GitHub stars** on April 3, 2026. Thank you to every contributor, source project, issue reporter, and user who keeps this library useful.

## New Skills

- **agentflow** - merges PR #438 to add Kanban-style multi-worker orchestration guidance for Claude Code development pipelines.
- **uxui-principles** - merges PR #441 to add research-backed UX/UI audit guidance sourced from the `uxuiprinciples/agent-skills` collection.
- **agentphone** - merges PR #442 to add phone-agent workflows for voice calls, SMS operations, number management, and streaming telephony flows.
- **humanize-chinese** - adds issue-driven coverage for Chinese AI-text detection, rewriting, academic AIGC reduction, and style-conversion workflows based on `voidborne-d/humanize-chinese`.

## Improvements

- **Selective installer filters** - the npm installer now supports `--risk <csv>`, `--category <csv>`, and `--tags <csv>` with comma-separated include values, trailing `-` exclusions, OR semantics within each flag, exclusion precedence, and AND semantics across dimensions.
- **Tag-aware filtering** - installer filtering now reads skill frontmatter directly so `tags` can participate in install selection even though `skills_index.json` does not store them.
- **Recursive install sync** - install manifests now track nested skill paths consistently, and filtered updates prune stale managed entries instead of leaving old skills behind.
- **OpenCode guidance** - `README.md`, `docs/users/getting-started.md`, and `docs/users/faq.md` now explicitly recommend reduced installs for `.agents/skills` hosts and document the new filter grammar.
- **Source and contributor credits** - post-merge README credit sync now includes the upstream repositories reflected in this release batch, including `UrRhb/agentflow`, `AgentPhone-AI/skills`, `uxuiprinciples/agent-skills`, and `voidborne-d/humanize-chinese`.

## Who should care

- **Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI users** get four new skills covering workflow orchestration, UX/UI review, telephony agents, and Chinese text humanization.
- **OpenCode and other `.agents/skills` users** now have a supported reduced-install path instead of needing the full library in a context-sensitive runtime.
- **Maintainers and teams curating smaller agent surfaces** can now ship filtered installs by risk, category, and tag without manually pruning skill folders after each update.

Start here:

- Install: `npx antigravity-awesome-skills`
- Choose your tool: [README -> Choose Your Tool](https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills#choose-your-tool)
- Best skills by tool: [README -> Best Skills By Tool](https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills#best-skills-by-tool)
- Bundles: [docs/users/bundles.md](https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/bundles.md)
- Workflows: [docs/users/workflows.md](https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/workflows.md)

This release focuses on repository reliability rather than adding new skills. It hardens marketplace and plugin validation, adds stronger release-facing CI checks, refreshes the root README and source-credit ledger, and cleans up several maintainer and user docs so the public repo matches the active merge and release workflow on `main`.

## Improvements

- **Marketplace sync reliability** - made editorial bundle and plugin publication sync more atomic so generated marketplace state is staged and refreshed more predictably during maintainer flows.
- **Validation hardening** - tightened frontmatter parsing, plugin compatibility checks, and bundle/index validation to better defend against malformed or unsafe metadata.
- **Release CI guardrails** - added dedicated dependency-review and actionlint workflows, plus the corresponding shellcheck-safe workflow fix in CI.
- **README landing-page cleanup** - reorganized the root `README.md` so discovery, installation, and credits are easier to scan, and removed misplaced SEO wording.
- **Source credits refresh** - audited the credits ledger against current upstream sources and release history, removed the dead `sstklen/claude-api-cost-optimization` entry, normalized stale descriptions, and added missing official/community repos now reflected in the README.
- **Maintainer merge policy** - updated `.github/MAINTENANCE.md` so every PR merge now explicitly requires checking and syncing both `### Community Contributors` and `## Repo Contributors`.
- **English documentation cleanup** - translated remaining mixed Italian phrasing in maintainer audit docs, workflow docs, and the Jetski Cortex integration guide to keep repository-facing documentation consistent.

## Changed

- **Generated repo state** - refreshed the sitemap, star-history asset, and metadata-driven README state as part of the current `main` sync flow.
- **Vietnamese credits mirror** - aligned the Vietnamese README copy with the current source-credit corrections that landed on the main README.
- **Release-facing tests** - updated consistency and metadata tests to match the refreshed README/docs wording and current release contract.

## Who should care

- **Maintainers** get a safer release path with stricter validation, clearer post-merge credit rules, and stronger CI checks before tags are cut.
- **Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and Antigravity users** get a cleaner root README and more accurate source attribution when discovering official and community skill collections.
- **Contributors and documentation-heavy users** get more consistent English-language docs across workflows, maintainer guidance, and integration references.

## Credits

- **Repository maintainers** for the post-`9.3.0` release hardening, CI additions, documentation cleanup, and source-credit audit on `main`

This release makes the repository much easier to use for Chinese-speaking developers while tightening contributor docs and expanding community-skill discovery. It ships the full `docs_zh-CN` translation batch, folds in a markdown fence fix for contributor documentation, strengthens `github-issue-creator` discoverability metadata, and carries forward the recent `SoulPass` community listing on `main`.

## New

- **Chinese documentation set** - merged PR #423 with a full Simplified Chinese translation pass across user, contributor, maintainer, and integration docs under `docs_zh-CN`, plus glossary and validation assets.

## Improvements

- **Contributor docs formatting** - merged PR #418 to correct nested fenced-code examples in `docs/contributors/skill-anatomy.md`, making the markdown examples render correctly for contributors.
- **Community discovery** - current `main` includes the `SoulPass` Community Contributed Skills listing requested in issue #421, keeping Solana wallet, trading, and agent-identity workflows easy to discover.
- **Issue triage cleanup** - improved `github-issue-creator` metadata and usage guidance so external discovery tools can classify and recommend it more accurately.

This release makes the new plugin distribution model a user-facing feature. Claude Code now has a formal root marketplace plugin plus generated bundle plugins, and Codex now ships the equivalent repo-local root plugin plus generated bundle plugins. The release also consolidates plugin documentation into a canonical user guide, aligns onboarding docs around the difference between the full repository and the plugin-safe subset, and packages the latest merge batch on `main`.

## New

- **Claude Code plugin distribution** - formalized the root `.claude-plugin` marketplace entry plus generated bundle plugins as a first-class install path.
- **Codex plugin distribution** - formalized the root Codex plugin metadata in `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` and `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, alongside generated bundle plugins.
- **Canonical plugin documentation** - added `docs/users/plugins.md` to explain plugin-safe filtering, root plugin vs bundle plugins, and when to prefer plugins over the full library install.
- **akf-trust-metadata** - merged PR #406, adding the new `akf-trust-metadata` skill to the repository.

## Improvements

- **Onboarding alignment** - updated `README.md`, `docs/users/getting-started.md`, `docs/users/faq.md`, `docs/users/claude-code-skills.md`, `docs/users/codex-cli-skills.md`, `docs/users/bundles.md`, and `docs/users/usage.md` so the plugin story is explained consistently.
- **Community discovery** - merged PR #407 to add the CoinPaprika & DexPaprika listing to the community-contributed section of the README.
- **Maintainer release batch** - merged both open PRs through the documented GitHub squash flow, then packaged the resulting `main` branch as a full release instead of a tag-only cut.

## Who should care

- **Claude Code users** now have a cleaner choice between full-library install, root marketplace plugin, and smaller bundle plugins.
- **Codex users** now get the same plugin distribution model instead of relying only on direct `.codex/skills/` installs.
- **Maintainers and team leads** can onboard people with plugin-safe starter surfaces while keeping the full repository as the broader source of truth.

## [8.7.1] - 2026-03-23 - "Release Pipeline Repair"

> Patch release to restore npm publication after the `v8.7.0` GitHub Release failed before reaching the npm registry.

Start here:

- Install: `npx antigravity-awesome-skills`
- Choose your tool: [README -> Choose Your Tool](https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills#choose-your-tool)
- Best skills by tool: [README -> Best Skills By Tool](https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills#best-skills-by-tool)
- Bundles: [docs/users/bundles.md](https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/bundles.md)
- Workflows: [docs/users/workflows.md](https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/workflows.md)

This patch release keeps the `8.7.0` skill/library content intact and fixes the release pipeline so npm publication works end-to-end again. The root cause was that the publish workflow only installed root dependencies before building `apps/web-app`, leaving the web app without its own `node_modules` in CI.

## Improvements

- **npm publish repair**: Updated the publish workflow to install `apps/web-app` dependencies before the web build, matching the working GitHub Pages workflow and preventing the missing-React/missing-Vite TypeScript cascade seen in CI.
- **Release verification hardening**: Added deterministic web-app installation to the maintainer release suite so `release:preflight` and `release:prepare` now catch this class of failure before a GitHub Release is published.
- **Deterministic installs**: Switched the shared `app:install` script to `npm ci` so local and CI web-app installs use the same locked dependency graph.

## Who should care

- **Maintainers** can cut releases again without the publish workflow failing during the web-app build.
- **npm users** can finally receive the `8.7.x` catalog and skill updates through the package registry instead of being stuck on `8.4.0`.
- **Web-app contributors** get a cleaner release contract where CI explicitly prepares the frontend before building it.

## [8.7.0] - 2026-03-23 - "Reference Recovery and Release Reliability"

> Installable skill library update for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, and related AI coding assistants.

- Workflows: [docs/users/workflows.md](https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/workflows.md)

This release packages the maintainer sweep after `v8.6.0`: restored missing C++ reference material, added three new community skills plus the maintainer-integrated `jobgpt` skill, and fixed the Jetski lazy-loader example so release validation no longer fails on a raw TypeScript import.

## New Skills

- **moyu** - anti-over-engineering guardrails for AI coding agents that need to stay narrowly scoped and prefer the smallest viable change (PR #384)
- **windows-shell-reliability** - practical Windows PowerShell and CMD guidance for encoding, quoting, logging, and detached process launches (PR #386)
- **jobgpt** - JobGPT MCP integration for job search automation, resume generation, application tracking, salary insights, and recruiter outreach (local maintainer integration from PR #388)

## Improvements

- **cpp-pro restoration**: Restored the missing `cpp-pro` nested reference guides and implementation playbook so the skill's documented deep links work again (PR #383, issue #382).
- **Release reliability**: Converted the Jetski Gemini loader example from `loader.ts` to a directly importable `loader.mjs`, updated repo references, and restored green local test coverage for the release pipeline.
- **Registry sync**: Refreshed `README.md`, `CATALOG.md`, `skills_index.json`, `data/catalog.json`, `data/bundles.json`, contributors, and tracked web assets so `main` now reflects `1,309+` indexed skills.
- **Metadata hardening**: Brought the merged `moyu` skill back within the frozen validation warning budget by adding explicit metadata and a `When to Use` section.

## Who should care

- **Claude Code and Cursor users** get four new or newly repaired skills, including scope-control guidance, better Windows shell reliability tips, and restored `cpp-pro` deep-dive references.
- **Codex CLI and Gemini CLI users** benefit from the same skill additions plus a working Jetski lazy-loader example that can now be imported directly in Node-based host setups.
- **Maintainers** get a release path that is green again end-to-end, with generated registry artifacts and contributor data re-synced on `main`.

- Workflows: [docs/users/workflows.md](https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/workflows.md)

This release packages the maintainer sweep after `v8.5.0`: the new `gdb-cli` community skill, removal of the stale in-repo `goldrush-api` copy, and a cross-platform recovery path for Antigravity users who hit truncation or context overload with too many active skills.

## New Skills

- **gdb-cli** - AI-assisted GDB debugging for core dumps, live process attach, crash triage, and deadlock analysis with source correlation (PR #375, closes #374)

## Improvements

- **Antigravity overload recovery**: Added `scripts/activate-skills.sh`, a matching installer hint, and new cross-platform user docs so Linux/macOS users can archive the full library and activate only the bundles or skill ids they need in the live Antigravity directory (issue #381).
- **Windows/Linux/macOS troubleshooting**: Expanded the recovery guidance with a shared overload guide plus clearer README, FAQ, and getting-started links for truncation and context-limit failures.
- **Registry cleanup**: Removed the stale in-repo `goldrush-api` mirror, regenerated bundle/catalog artifacts, and refreshed tracked web assets so canonical references no longer point at deleted content (PR #379).
- **Maintainer sync**: Refreshed `README.md`, `CATALOG.md`, `skills_index.json`, `data/catalog.json`, `data/bundles.json`, contributors, and sitemap output after the PR merge batch so `main` stays release-ready.

- Workflows: [docs/users/workflows.md](https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills/blob/main/docs/users/workflows.md)

This release captures everything that landed after `v8.4.0`: a safety fix for the installer migration path, two new in-repo bdistill skills, broader maintainer automation for metadata/release hygiene, refreshed generated artifacts for the `1,306+` skill catalog, and a new README community section for five OpenClaw skills.

## New Skills

- **bdistill-behavioral-xray** - self-probe an AI model across refusal, reasoning, formatting, grounding, persona, and tool-use dimensions, then generate a visual HTML report (PR #366)
- **bdistill-knowledge-extraction** - extract structured domain knowledge in-session or from local Ollama models into searchable/exportable reference datasets (PR #366)

## Improvements

- **Installer migration safety**: Replaced the destructive legacy migration path in `tools/bin/install.js` with a safety-backup flow so rerunning installs no longer wipes unrelated user skills from the target directory (PR #368, fixes issue #367).
- **Catalog growth and generated sync**: Imported the external marketing, SEO, Obsidian, and Anthropic-adjacent maintainer batch, then refreshed `README.md`, `CATALOG.md`, `skills_index.json`, `data/catalog.json`, bundles, and tracked web assets so `main` now reflects `1,306+` indexed skills.
- **Maintainer automation**: Added docs/package metadata sync, GitHub About sync, contributor sync, release-state sync, repo-state audits, and a frozen validation warning budget so maintainers can keep release artifacts and repo claims aligned with less manual drift.
- **Security and workflow hardening**: Tightened skill tooling file handling, clarified install/PR guidance, and kept CI/release automation aligned with the active source-only PR policy and repo hygiene workflows.
- **Community discovery**: Added a README community section linking five OpenClaw/Claude Code skills from FullStackCrew so users can discover adjacent external tooling from the main repository landing page (PR #370).

## Who should care

This release packages everything that landed after `v8.3.0`: new discovery and SEO surfaces for the catalog, GitHub Pages/web-app reliability fixes, metadata and index curation across the 1,273-skill registry, maintainer release/support polish, and the final merge sweep for PRs #363, #362, and #360.

## New Skills

- **None in this release** - `8.4.0` is a discovery, maintenance, and release-hardening cut rather than a new in-repo skill drop.

## Improvements

- **Catalog discovery and SEO**: Added repo growth discovery pages, finalized the web-app SEO layer for catalog routes, hardened JSON-LD/prerender behavior, expanded the home skills viewport, and improved GitHub Pages/base-path fetch fallbacks so the public catalog is more discoverable and stable.
- **Registry curation**: Expanded curated and uncategorized category coverage, normalized legacy catalog categories, improved safe-skill categorization, and refreshed generated starter packs/bundles to better organize the 1,273-skill library.
- **Metadata quality sweep**: Backfilled missing risk/source metadata, repaired actionable skill descriptions, and merged the `gha-security-review` metadata/usage cleanup so repository validation and review prompts stay more consistent.
- **Infrastructure hardening**: Merged PR #363 to move CI intake to `tools/scripts/pr_preflight.cjs`, localize ESM handling for the Jetski Gemini loader docs, and keep the security/test pipeline green without breaking CommonJS entrypoints.
- **Credits and repo polish**: Added `privacy-mask` to README credits, added the X/community reference update, refreshed the star-history/support surfaces, and kept release-facing onboarding/docs aligned with the current catalog state.

## Who should care

## [7.9.2] - 2026-03-15 - "npm CLI Packaging Fix"

> **Patch release to fix the published npm CLI bundle so `npx antigravity-awesome-skills` resolves its runtime helper modules correctly**

This release fixes a packaging regression in the published npm artifact. Version `7.9.1` shipped `tools/bin/install.js` without the required `tools/lib` runtime helpers, causing `npx antigravity-awesome-skills` to fail with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `../lib/symlink-safety`.

## New Skills

- **None in this release** — `7.9.2` is a focused patch release for the npm installer bundle.

## Improvements

- **npm package contents**: Expanded the published `files` whitelist to ship `tools/lib/*` alongside `tools/bin/*`, restoring the runtime dependency required by the installer entrypoint.
- **Regression coverage**: Added a package-contents test that checks `npm pack --dry-run --json` and asserts the published tarball includes both `tools/bin/install.js` and `tools/lib/symlink-safety.js`.
- **CLI verification**: Verified the extracted packaged entrypoint runs successfully with `--help`, confirming the published layout no longer reproduces the missing-module crash reported in issue `#315`.

## Credits

- **Issue #315 reporter** for isolating the npm packaging regression in the published CLI artifact.

## [7.9.1] - 2026-03-15 - "Security Hardening Follow-up"

> **Follow-up release to 7.9.0: same security batch, additional hardening focused on mutating endpoints, markdown rendering, and doc-risk enforcement**

This release is a companion follow-up to `7.9.0` and applies security controls for the web app runtime, runtime refresh endpoint, and documentation quality gates.

## New Skills

- **None in this release** — this is a follow-up security maintenance release.

## Improvements

- **Endpoint hardening (mutating API)**: The `/api/refresh-skills` endpoint is now protected by strict local-only ingress rules, explicit token support (`SKILLS_REFRESH_TOKEN` when configured), explicit method validation, and explicit host/Origin checks before any state-changing logic runs.
- **Front-end hardening**: Added POST-only sync from UI and removed unsafe HTML passthrough (`rehype-raw`) from `SkillDetail`, reducing the runtime XSS surface.
- **Documentation risk controls**: Added a full-repo `SKILL.md` security scan for dangerous command patterns (`curl|bash`, `wget|sh`, `irm|iex`, obvious command-line token examples), with opt-in comment allowlisting.
- **Security test coverage**: Added dedicated security tests for endpoint authorization/host/token behavior and markdown rendering behavior, and wired docs security checks into the shared test and CI pipeline.
- **Tooling robustness**: Improved YAML date normalization for frontmatter parsing and index generation so unquoted ISO dates remain stable as strings across tooling.

## Credits

- **Internal security hardening pass** covering endpoint, rendering, and docs scanning controls.

## [7.9.0] - 2026-03-15 - "Codex Security Remediation Sweep"

> **Verified and remediated the active security batch on `main`, with triage and fixes delivered thanks to Codex Security with Codex for OSS**

This release is a focused security maintenance cut. We used Codex Security with Codex for OSS as the triage input, verified every reported finding against the current default branch, collapsed duplicates and obsolete reports, then shipped the confirmed fixes in remediation buckets before merging the final set onto `main`.

## New Skills

- **None in this release** — `7.9.0` is intentionally a security and maintenance release.

## Improvements

- **Filesystem trust boundaries**: Hardened path, symlink, and archive extraction handling across setup, install, sync, metadata, normalization, indexing, and local dev serving flows.
- **Auth and integrity defaults**: Disabled shared frontend star writes by default unless explicitly enabled, and restored TLS verification defaults in the `junta-leiloeiros` scrapers with an explicit opt-out for insecure targets.
- **Shell safety**: Removed pipe-to-shell and token-on-command-line guidance from the Apify docs, and fixed the audio transcription example so shell values are no longer interpolated directly into Python source.
- **Robustness fixes**: Rejected non-mapping YAML frontmatter in validation paths, moved local state files out of predictable shared `/tmp` locations, repaired malformed metadata, and removed committed Python bytecode artifacts.
- **Regression coverage**: Added focused JS, Python, and web-app tests that prove the remediations and guard the reported root causes from reappearing.
- **Security triage artifacts**: Added maintainer-facing triage outputs at `docs/maintainers/security-findings-triage-2026-03-15.{md,csv}` documenting all 33 findings, including why each one was still valid, duplicate, or obsolete on `HEAD`.

## Credits

- **Codex Security with Codex for OSS** for surfacing and structuring the security batch that drove this release.

## [7.8.0] - 2026-03-14 - "Marketplace & Merge Sweep"

> **Merged seven community PRs, added Claude Code marketplace manifests, and finished the maintainer sync/release pass**

This release closes the active maintenance batch in one pass. It ships a new Claude Code plugin marketplace entrypoint for the whole repository, merges seven open community pull requests after maintainer preflight, removes stale Windows symlink guidance from the user docs, and refreshes the generated registry artifacts on `main` for a single `7.8.0` cut.

## New Skills

- **analyze-project** — root-cause analyst workflow for full-project diagnosis (PR #297)
- **latex-paper-conversion** — convert academic papers into reusable engineering artifacts (PR #296)
- **k6-load-testing** — k6-based API and performance testing guidance (PR #287)
- **tool-use-guardian** — tool-call reliability wrapper with retries, recovery, and failure classification (PR #298)
- **recallmax** — long-context memory, summarization, and conversation compression for agents (PR #298)

## Improvements

- **Claude Code marketplace support**: Added `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` so the repository can be installed as a single Claude Code marketplace plugin (PR #302, closes #288).
- **Windows installer/docs alignment**: Removed the stale `core.symlinks=true` / Developer Mode guidance from user docs after the Windows installer cleanup (PR #299, fixes #286, follow-up #281 closed in release).
- **NotebookLM cleanup**: Removed unused `typing.Optional` / `typing.List` imports from `skills/notebooklm/scripts/browser_utils.py` (PR #301, closes #300).
- **README/source maintenance**: Added maintained attribution for external-sourced skills and merged the `uberSKILLS` README addition without generated-file drift (PRs #298 and #293).
- **Batch merge workflow**: Completed a maintainer preflight for PRs #301, #299, #297, #296, #287, #298, and #293, then regenerated `README.md`, `skills_index.json`, `CATALOG.md`, and `data/*.json` once on `main`.
- **Issue hygiene**: Closed #288, #300, #286, and #281 from the shipped fixes; documented existing support for #294 in the release follow-up.

## [7.7.0] - 2026-03-13 - "Merge Friction Reduction"

> **Shipped four maintained PR outcomes, stabilized generated-file CI, and cut release friction for future contributor merges**

This release turns a noisy maintainer workflow into a predictable one. It merges the latest community skill additions, integrates the cleaned `privacy-by-design` contribution under the maintainer exception path, and removes the biggest source of PR churn by making generated registry drift informational on pull requests while keeping `main` self-healing and strict.

## New Skills

- **llm-structured-output** — structured JSON/schema extraction patterns across OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini (PR #280)
- **electron-development** — secure Electron architecture, IPC hardening, packaging, signing, and updates (PR #282)
- **privacy-by-design** — privacy-first software design patterns and implementation guidance (PR #283)
- **antigravity-skill-orchestrator** — meta-skill for selecting and coordinating the best skill set for a task (PR #285)

## Improvements

- **CI determinism**: `tools/scripts/update_readme.py` and `tools/scripts/sync_repo_metadata.py` now preserve volatile README sync metadata during normal runs instead of rewriting stars/timestamps and causing PR drift.
- **PR merge flow**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now reports generated registry drift as informational on PRs while keeping `main` strict and auto-syncing the final artifact set after merge.
- **Maintainer docs**: Updated `.github/MAINTENANCE.md`, `docs/maintainers/ci-drift-fix.md`, and `docs/maintainers/merging-prs.md` to document the new lower-friction merge procedure.
- **Windows issue triage**: Clarified that issue `#281` remains open as an installer/symlink problem distinct from truncation-loop issue `#274`, closed `#284` against the shipped recovery guidance, and opened follow-up issue `#286`.

## [7.6.0] - 2026-03-12 - "Maintenance Sweep"

> **Merged community PRs, documented Windows truncation recovery, and hardened Metasploit setup guidance**

This release finishes a focused maintenance sweep across open pull requests and issues. It merges four community updates, ships the Jetski/Gemini overflow and path-safety documentation from the context overflow fix, adds a Windows recovery guide for truncation crash loops, and removes the non-deterministic Metasploit installer flow from the security skill.

## New Skills

- **acceptance-orchestrator** — acceptance-driven execution orchestration (PR #277)
- **closed-loop-delivery** — delivery workflow with feedback loops (PR #277)
- **create-issue-gate** — issue creation quality gate (PR #277)
- **interview-coach** — interview preparation and coaching (PR #272)

## Improvements

- **PR maintenance**: Merged PRs #277, #272, #275, #278, and #271 using GitHub squash merge so all contributors receive merge credit.
- **Jetski/Gemini loader docs**: Documented `overflowBehavior` handling and `skillsRoot`-confined path validation in the reference loader and integration guide (PR #271).
- **Windows recovery docs**: Added `docs/users/windows-truncation-recovery.md` and linked it from the main user docs for truncation/context crash loops on Windows.
- **Metasploit safety**: Replaced the remote installer pattern in `skills/metasploit-framework/SKILL.md` with an explicit "Metasploit must already be installed" prerequisite, and marked the skill as `risk: offensive` with the required warning.
- **Repo sync**: Refreshed README metadata, generated registry files, and contributor acknowledgements before release.
