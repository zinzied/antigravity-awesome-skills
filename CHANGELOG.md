## [5.10.0] - 2026-02-21 - "AWS Kiro CLI Integration"

> **Native support and integration guide for AWS Kiro CLI, expanding the repository's reach to the AWS developer community.**

This release adds comprehensive support for Kiro CLI, AWS's recently launched agentic IDE, enabling 883+ skills to enhance Kiro's autonomous operations across serverless, IaC, and AWS architectures. It also includes an important bugfix for the npm installer CLI.

## 🚀 Improvements

- **Integration Guide**: Added `docs/KIRO_INTEGRATION.md` detailing Kiro capabilities, installation instructions, AWS-recommended skills, and MCP usage.
- **Documentation**: Updated `README.md`, `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md`, and `docs/FAQ.md` to formally support Kiro CLI and add invocation examples.
